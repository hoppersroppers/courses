# Secure Yourself Now
You signed up for this course to improve yourself, to learn how to secure yourself online, and to help others. That's what this section is dedicated to. If you finish this section and don't do anything else, your participation in this course will be a success in my eyes. Maybe not in your chain of command's but that's a completely different story. 

Of course, I would prefer you to continue in the course, but I'm glad you are here, and I hope you stick around. 

You're working from home, off your personal computer, so first, congratulations on all the bandwidth. You are all security professionals, so I know I don't have to drive this point home too hard, but the computers that you defend and maintain at work are significantly more secure than the one you are accessing this course from. You know everything I am about to tell you, but I'm going to tell you it again.

Your first assignment is to start using a password manager.  Read this <https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/> to learn about password managers, and then install one, I  recommend <https://lastpass.com/>. There's plenty of other password managers out there, but I've been using this one forever and that is the only reason I recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers. If you don't want to do this now, skip it, I make sure you do it later in the course. 

Your second task, if you do not already have one installed, is to install an ad-blocking extension. Ad-blockers do what they say they do, making your web experience significantly better, but also block trackers and lessen the chance of getting malware laden ads.  For Chrome, I recommend uBlock Origin: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en>. I don't use Firefox, but it has an ad-blocker built in which makes it the best choice for the privacy and security conscious. I also recommend installing Chrome and ad-blockers (or Firefox) on as many computers of friends and family that you do tech support for. If you don't want to do this now, skip it, I make sure you do it later in the course. 

I'd like to think you don't already have malware on your computer but if you are working off of a shared family computer, there's a decent chance if you haven't checked recently. First, ensure that Windows Defender is enabled. If it isn't, turn it on. After you've done that, turn on automatic updates and ensure your computer is completely updated. If it isn't, update now. Once again, do this on as many computers as you are responsible for. You do it at work, do it home. If you're not on Windows, good luck not downloading malware you 1337 hardo. You'll probably be fine.

I know this stuff is obvious, but it's easy to be complacent when we get home. We know what best practices are, so do them.

# Computer Related Health
You probably spend a ton of time in front of a computer at work, but now that you're at home, your setup might not be what it was. If you're going to be working through this course, competing in our CTF, or binging Netflix, these are a few changes you can constantly put into practice that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Ergonomics
* Read this: <https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169>
1. Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an investment. If you have a laptop, find a keyboard and mouse and set the laptop up on top of books to get it to the right height when you are sitting down. Try to avoid having a laptop on your lap, get it on a table and sit in a chair. 

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.
* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can download this and it will change your life. <https://justgetflux.com/>
   * Windows has this option by default now, so check for that before downloading flux.
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses, they should be pretty cheap (>$30). I swear by mine, but hey, whatever, it keeps my eyes from hurting when I am about to spend 12 hours scrolling packet captures.

# General Wellness
#### Coronavirus
   * You are likely working from home right now and should be practicing social distancing
   * For a great unofficial guide, check out <https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/>
   * For the official .gov website, visit: <https://www.coronavirus.gov/>

#### Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously
   * You should be going to the bathroom every 2-4 hours
   * Caffeine, and especially drinks like coffee and energy drinks dehydrate you 

#### Sleep
   * Everyone loves bragging about being a hardo and sleeping four hours a night for months on end... guess what? It's not just stupid, it's actively hurting you in a variety of ways
    * <https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-deprivation-and-deficiency>

#### Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink Monsters as your only sustenance for the day. Order in some Chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be pizza. 
   * Cook your own food every once in a while. Instant ramen doesn't count. Cooking is fun as hell. Do it. 

#### Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death. Getting your heart rate elevated for a few minutes a day is good for you, full stop. Do it. 
   * Even if the PRT is cancelled you should still work out. 
   * Looking for great resource for this, please recommend one if you have it. 

####  Neurodiversity
   * Hackers are known for our neurodiversity, and our brains let us do amazing things, but sometimes they work in ways that don't always make the most sense to us and the people around us. Here are some resources to help understand what you or other people experience every day.
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml>
  * <https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adhd-attention-deficit-disorder-in-adults.htm>
  * If you have questions about medication, talk to your command's doc to get a referral to Mental Health. It's a process but it's worth it. 

#### Mental Health
   * The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun, but it is worth having all the resources you can. Read all of these. Help yourself or help your friends. 
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml>
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/index.shtml>

There is a group named the Mental Health Hackers who are pretty cool and worth a look  <https://twitter.com/hackershealth>.

# Questions
Alright, you probably didn't expect this line of questioning in this course, and yet, here we are. Serious business time, three quick questions.

1. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?

2. Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? If so, have you thought about how you might do this? 

3. In the past three months, have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, visit <https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/> or call 1-800-273-8255. 

If you don't want to talk to a stranger, my name is Dennis, text or call me at 914-299-7537, email me, or message me on here. As an important note, I am not in your chain of command, so my interpretation is that I am not required to report any conversations I have. If anyone disagrees, let me know. 

It's okay to not be okay, talk to someone.

# Why?
You thought you were here to learn how to get better at computers so what is all this? 

Well, hopefully your end goal of all this is that you become a better person and have a better life. If you want to be good at computers just for the sake of being good at computers that counts for something too, but to me, all this technology is just a way for me to accomplish more than I could by myself. 

If you're going to be doing anything in this world, might as well take care of yourself first. Learning security comes far after you and your well-being. 

Now, on to the show!

# Letter from the Author
## Dedication
This training is dedicated to the memories of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), [Bassel Khartabil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil) and those named on the [National Cryptologic Memorial](https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/cryptologic-memorial/cryptologic-memorial-list.shtml).

## Letter from the Author
After a decade of teaching myself how to use computers and a few years training others, I went and made the site that I wish had existed when I got into the field back in middle school. 

Security is the shield of the modern world, and we need good people on the wall.  Thanks for being up there.

Hack the planet

# Why Security?
Computer security is the shield of the modern age. Without the constant battle on the frontlines between the people who want to see technology used for good and the people who want to use it for their own gain, or worse, to limit the rights and freedoms of others, the progress that occurs in the real world because of technology would be dramatically slowed. Security allows trust in technology, which leads to adoption, which leads to progress in one direction, or another. The more people able to help out with that fight, the faster we can move as a society, and less things will get broken and less people will be hurt on the way. That?s why this site exists, and hopefully, if you?re here for the right reasons, you?ll be able to jump into the fight with the tools you need to succeed.

This course is designed to give you the mindset and fundamental skills necessary to be successful in the information security field. If you already have some experience - great! But we do not to assume any prior knowledge of security or even information technology in general. At the end of this, you may not be a guru (hint: nobody knows everything), but you should have the mental models and base knowledge to use the Linux operating system, install new programs, and be equipped to find and understand the information you need to learn even more.

While I have tried to do everything in my ability to make this course self-guided, there are hundreds of places where a questioning attitude will identify clear shortfalls in the content. Some of these are intentional, most of them are not. Your questions and feedback will guide the development of this course so that it can become the best resource possible.

Surrounding this site is a community to help you and provide guidance as you move along. This community grows with each student who signs up, and our mentors will be there every step of the way to answer questions, explain difficult concepts, and talk about just about anything to help you along the way. Make sure to take full advantage of the many ways we provide to message other mentors so that we can all be part of this together.

# Hopper's ...
We named out team after Grace Hopper because she is our favorite person in Navy computing history. You probably know who she is. 


Have you ever heard the quote, ?It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.?? That was her. 

![alt text](https://i2.wp.com/hopperboulder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Grace1-2.jpg?w=704&ssl=1 "img1")

This quote comes from an interview in the July 1986 CHIP?s Ahoy Magazine, the Department of the Navy?s Information Technology Magazine. She was at the cutting edge then and it is a testament to her vision how well this interview stands up to the test of time. Her passion for knowledge and innovation is the most important thing you can carry with you.

# ... ROPpers
While there was a chance you knew what Hopper's meant, it is very unlikely that you have had any idea what Roppers meant, mostly because it is a word we made up to define a group of people who ROP. And if you have never heard of ROP, or Return Oriented Programming before, and.... that is not just okay, that is expected, because why on earth would you have known about an obscure programming topic before this exact moment in time. To quote Wikipedia, "Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as non-executable memory (W xor X technique) and code signing by chaining together carefully chosen machine instruction sequences to get control of the stack..."

Don't worry; none of that should have meant anything to you. That would have made zero sense to me when I was sitting where you are sitting. Two years into my journey, I would have understood about half of it. Now at least I know what all the words mean, but I rely on friends who know more than me if I have questions.

While many other sites that attempt to teach this material assume you already know a great deal of knowledge, we take a different approach to make this challenging subject as approachable as possible. For all of the great resources out there, and all of the incredible pieces of training, nothing walks a complete beginner all the way through the process of developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals. Everyone wants to learn how to do stuff, but very quickly they realize that there is no way for them to learn everything. They?re not wrong, the vast and constantly expanding body of knowledge about this field makes it impossible for anyone to keep up. But what is most important for the beginner to realize is that with the proper knowledge of the fundamentals and a firm grasp on the hacker mentality, that irrepressible drive to learn and to do, nothing is too complex for them to learn if they put the time in. By managing your high expectations of yourself, providing constant feedback on your progress, and bringing you into the community, this is designed to minimize dropout rate while providing the best first hundred hours of a cyber security education possible.

# Core Tenets
![alt text](https://news.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/horizontal_image/public/d6_files/YaleNews_hopper-grace.UNIVAC.102635875-CC_0.jpg?itok=4HL3ETlO "img3")

This site is designed around a series of ideas that we think will make your experience as a learner as good as possible.

1. No initial expectation of knowledge
2. Everyone moves at their own pace
3. Understanding foundational theory comes before building technical skills
4. Developing fundamental technical skills lays the groundwork for success in any topic
5. Knowledge must be actionable
6. The measure of a community is how they treat those who are trying to gain entry
7. There is no such thing as being done learning

Anytime something on this site doesn't seem to be matching up with our core tenets, let us know so I can fix it. We made as many possible mechanisms for you to help us improve our approach, the content, and the community of this site as possible. This site is a living entity and will change on a regular basis so that we can improve your experience.

# So What is ROP?
All you need to know right now is that ROP is an advanced exploitation technique which beats advanced defenses by chaining together code which was already in a program. That definition is good enough for now, but if you stick around with us, soon enough you will know what it means and eventually you will be writing ROP chains of your own. The critical bit to understand is that you take snippets of existing code, chain it back together in a new order, and then use those to jump to where you need to go next. As you go through this course you will do the same thing, rearranging already learned information and skills to jump to new locations.

Nothing in this course is spoonfed, and while we try to give you good resources, there are multiple parts in the course where we tell you to swing by yourself and go find out how to do something. We do this when we know there are plenty of other high quality resources out there for you to learn from and we want you to become comfortable being given no direction other than a couple searchterms and having to rely on your own knowledge and problem solving skills.

## Content
This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of the Boat School's Cyber Security Team and various guides scattered throughout the internet on how to break into information security. We put this curriculum together by aggregating all of the guides and tutorials we could find, took what we thought was important and added our own commentary. To say that this is built on the backs of a hundred other people's work would be an understatement, and we am forever grateful that we are part of a community which has created so many amazing resources. All attempts to cite source material have been made, if there is anything we have not properly attributed, let us know. Despite having been in the works for the last four years, this is the first iteration of the curriculum and it should change drastically as we see what does and doesn't work, and the only way we will know is feedback.

# Legal
## Community Guidelines
Our community guidelines are available here: <https://www.hoppersroppers.org/guidelines.html>. Please read them over.

## Legal Stuff
Unsurprisingly, in this course you will learn some things that could be used to do bad things. You might not think they're bad things at the time, and they might seem like funny pranks, but the laws against hacking are very vague. Even more importantly, you probably have a security clearance, and having a pile of felonies you have to admit to is not a great look and will complicate your paperwork.

In the US, the law that surrounds this stuff is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Basically, all you need to know is that every computer is a protected computer and that it is a crime to intentionally access a computer or account without authorization or to exceed authorized access.

Exceed authorized access is a real sticky subject, and it has led to a bunch of unfortunate prosecutions. 

To stay on the safe side, only access computers you own, or have written consent to access. You're lucky, because we have an entire network of training computers you can do whatever you want on. A lot of people don't, and that's where they get in trouble while trying to learn.  

It should also be mentioned that copyright law is also a good way to get in trouble, not to mention that if you see software to pirate on the internet, it is very unlikely that it doesn't contain malware. Just don't steal things, we can almost always get a copy of whatever you want, it just might take some paperwork and some emails.

## Classification
Absolutely nothing here is classified, in any way, whatsoever. Nothing is derived from classified information.

# Join Us
## Slack
Instant group messaging has been a cultural staple of the internet community since its inception, as it is truly one of the most important functions that global interconnectedness can serve. 

Slack has become the messaging platform of choice, allowing group collaboration and real time chat along with various plug-ins and file hosting integration. We use it for many of feedback, support, as a forum, and as our primary instant messaging channel. At some point we might migrate to a self-hosted server, but for now, Slack is the easiest to work with.

Join our channel at <https://launchpass.com/hoppersroppers> and post a hello!

If this is not working for you, it is because you have an ad-blocker installed. If you do, whitelist the site or open it in Incognito mode and enter your email. We'll learn all about ad-blockers and why that broke the site for you later. If you continue having problems, message us here or email us. 

Choose a nickname, or what we call online, a "handle" for yourself. Don't worry about it too much, you will come up with something good eventually, and you are not stuck with whatever you start with. As a general rule, don't call yourself something like "Dark Shadow". Unless you want to. In that case, do that. I probably had a dozen or so before settling on my current one, 'deevnull'. I liked mine because it is a nerd joke (that will be explained about halfway through this course) and incorporates my last name.  Send me a message with a brief introduction to let me know you joined. We use Slack for just about everything from helping on problems, submitting feedback, or just talking about random things.

## Twitter
Unsurprisingly, information security Twitter is a very exciting place. In the modern age, where information flows at the speed of light, Twitter is the place to be if you want to stay informed and on the cutting edge. It is an overwhelming amount of information, so you want to start off following only a few accounts. It is going to be a lot for you right now to actually try to read and understand the firehose, so we will start you slow and with a small number of beginner-friendly follows that really only post news. If you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it.

### Optional:
Create a "professional" twitter account! Remember, this twitter will be able to be associated with you, even if you want to stay pseudo-anonymous. Always keep it fun and professional. Now subscribe to this list, or just follow them: <https://twitter.com/deevnull/lists/cst>. This list has been curated to only include must follows with a range of jobs that will provide insight into what is happening around the field.

Follow @HoppersRoppers on twitter so we can follow you. Again, if you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it. It is mostly just a giant waste of time, but it is interesting and you learn a ton.

# The Team
## The 'Competitive' Team

This site is designed for getting you up to speed so you can confidently compete in security competitions. What this site is not is a series of competition problems for you to solve, which while seemingly the obvious way to teach this, winds up discouraging learners early by really kicking the crap out of them. We teach the basics, and the next course will be where you find yourself facing down challenges. Luckily, that is way easier of a course to make, because I just borrow them from old competitions. This course is to prepare you, not to get you experience in competition. It's a different approach philosophically, but it will pay off. 

When you sign up for this site, you automatically become a member of our not-at-all competitive team, which also happens to be named Hopper's Roppers. This whole site is grown out of the training I made for my college security team who competed in various cyber security competitions. Now, Hopper's Roppers is a distributed team, open to anyone, but is especially meant to be a place for beginners to learn the ropes in and we will participate in any event we have the numbers for. You will not be ready to compete while you are still working your way through this course... the good news, is you don't need to be ready to compete to do it. All you have to do is sign up, know your brain is going to hurt and you probably won't understand anything, and be ready to learn. 

The primary type of security competitions are CTFs, or Capture the Flags. This is a great resource to learn about CTFs. <https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/>. All of the training here is built around the idea of preparing you for success in the security field, and there is no better measure of ability, grit, and the hacker mentality than playing in a competition. Every CTF requires you to use what you already know to identify what you will need to learn on the spot to solve the problem. As you are now a member of our team, we will let you know when competitions are occuring and we hope to see you there if you have the time. Even if you are new and don't think you have anything to contribute, you will learn more picking someone's brain as you shoulder-surf them (or watch them on Twitch) than you possibly could trying to learn by yourself.

# This Stuff is Hard
Doing cool things with computers is hard (have I said that before), and yes there is an aspect that requires technical knowledge, but mostly, it just takes time. Doing cool things with computers is less of a technical challenge and more of an attitude and a willingness to work hard and teach yourself what you need to know in order to succeed in whatever you are trying to do. Our curriculum here is meant to give you the basic tools you will need to understand the challenges you face, but solving them is going to be on you. We'll be honest, this isn't easy. This isn't something that will take you a month or two to get the hang of. One of the primary curses of doing cool shit with computers is that each time you learn something, you immediately realize a new pile of things that you do not know. There's nothing wrong with not knowing things, and no one could ever expect you to. Even "experts" will only know a small slice of the greater field that is doing cool things with computers. Expecting anyone to be good at everything is ridiculous, but it is even more ridiculous for anyone to think a beginner should know everything... or really, anything. There's a lot of acronyms, slang, in-jokes, and domain specific knowledge. One of the promises we will make to you is that we will not ever put in an acronym, slang, or in-joke without explaining it.

If you can stick with and complete this course, you will be armed with the baseline knowledge and attitude you need to be able to learn anything. Probably the most important skill you will learn is how to use all of your resources effectively, whether that is your classmates, teachers, reference pages, or Google. Mostly, Google. It will take a year or two before you get comfortable and stop feeling totally lost every day, but then you'll just start working on harder problems and you'll wind up more confused than you could imagine being now. Being good at computering is a long term process of reinforcing and building on the basic knowledge we will teach you in this course, and it will never end until you decide the computers have won. Don't let the computers win, and keep learning everything you can.

# Hacker Attitude
Read this: <http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is> 

It isn't perfect, but it will do for now until I write a new one.?The biggest problem with this is that the author, while once a famous hacker and important member of the open source movement, is a total asshole. None of the content is bad, but we are in the process of trying to write something to replace all of his content in this curriculum.

While there is a lot in there that is very interesting, the most important part is the hacker attitude.

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.

2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.

3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.

4. Freedom is good.

5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.

These 5 statements provide a reasonable framework for how you should approach learning this material. It should be fun, we shouldn't be wasting your time, there should be multiple ways for you to succeed, and we are measuring success by your ability at the end.

# Hacker Ethic
From the same site as the Hacker How-To comes this brief description of the hacker ethic. Again, I am in the process of writing something else, but for now this is good enough.?  

Read it: [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html)

It breaks the hacker ethic into two main beliefs that complement one another:?


1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.

2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

A longer version of the hacker ethic comes from the famous book _Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution_ that you probably should read someday, but there is no rush. I haven't read the whole thing yet. ?

The Wikipedia article is pretty good so read it:?[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic)

They come out to six key beliefs:

1. Access to computers?and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works?should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!  
2. All information should be free (Often a topic of debate, he means free as in speech, rather than free as in beer)?
3. ?Mistrust authority?promote decentralization
4. ?Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer. The concept of "hack value" is doing something that is worth doing because of the "playful cleverness" required.?
6. ?Computers can change your life for the better

# RTFM
One of the key parts of this mindset is sharing knowledge with others. A great quote on the subject is 'There is?nothing noble?in?being superior?to your fellow man; true nobility is?being superior?to your former self.' ?Not to mention, the more you give back to the community, the greater the value you provide. If you're just starting off, you might not think you have anything to provide, but in fact, you're looking at the world with a different perspective than someone who has done it for years. For example, you can provide feedback on when training makes no sense or isn't as effective as it could be, and help make it easier for the next person to go through it. This site is a work in progress and the more feedback we receive the better it will be. ?

With that said, you're definitely going to have questions. There are nearly infinite resources out there, and it is rare that you wind up doing something no one has ever done before. If you think you are there, message someone or make a post in the forum so we can all look for resources, and congratulations. Before that you have google and people here to help you, and we will always try to help in any way that we can. One of the worst things about hacker culture is this idea that someone should ?Read the F-ing Manual? or ?RTFM?. The first recorded use of this was in a user manual for some program in 1979, so it goes way back. On first glance, RTFM is a great response for any question that should have been answered by a casual glance at the manual. The problem with this idea is that a large body of knowledge is usually required to understand the manual, and even before that, you need to know the manual exists. If you are taking this course, there is no possible way you can be expected to understand a manual because you are just getting started. 

# Man-Pages
The most common "manual" you will come across in this course and your travels through hackerdom are the man-pages that accompany every single aspect of the Unix operating system, and they are a great resource for people who have spent years learning how to understand them. Right now, you don?t have the knowledge to be expected to understand how they work, and that is fine. There is no pressure to know anything, but there is pressure to learn.?

The comic web site Xkcd is a nerd cultural treasure and you will see it referenced constantly. Read [this comic](https://xkcd.com/1692/)

# Alt-Text 
You might be thinking to yourself... what is alt-text? Funny you ask that. Depending on your current browser, figure out how to view the web page's source code for <https://xkcd.com/1692/>. This might require some Googling. What you are looking at is hypertext markup language or HTML for short. HTML is the language that websites are made of. (If you already knew that, good for you, I promise that the rest of the course gets significantly more in depth.) You will learn more later, but for now, look at the code and find where the main picture is stored in the webpage. Now do you understand what alt-text means? 

# In Defense of RTFM
RTFM gets a bad rap for good reason, because it is usually used as a put down on someone who doesn't know much about a subject... with that said, once you have the knowledge to understand a topic, if you are using that software, you should read the manual. Even if you don't understand the manual, if you are going to ask a question, you might as well reference that you know the manual exists and that what you are asking is referenced, you just need clarification. If you ask questions effectively you will find you understand your initial question and the topic much better than if you had someone explain the answer to just your specific question.

# Google
There are very very few questions you are going to ask that Google can't answer. But for right now, you probably don't even know what you should be googling for. Luckily, you have people here who can help you. One of the best questions you can ask people for is for search terms on a subject. That way they don't have to spend time explaining it, and you get all the benefits of doing the research yourself. You might already know some cool google tricks to get better results, but don't worry... we will teach you all of them until you are wise in the ways of Google Fu.

# Questions
We expect you to be constantly coming across words, phrases, and entire concepts that you have never seen before and are totally lost in. When you have to get things done, you'll have to learn more about it and one of the best ways to get those holes in your knowledge filled is to ask questions. 

Here are some guidelines for asking questions.

* There is no such thing as a bad question, especially on this site
* Write up your problem with as much information as possible
* Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order
* Describe the goal, not the step you are on
* Follow up with a brief note on the solution

You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. No one here will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough.?Even if your question isn't related to our courses, we are happy to help.

If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than Googling and you'll get more out of it.?

We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it.?

Visit this [man-page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write down the first three things you don?t understand.?(I don't expect you to make it past the Name, "bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell", there is so much to unpack in just that).

 Then Google one of them and figure out what it is. Submit a sentence or two explaining the thing you didn?t know.??For the love of everything, don?t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, ?Boredom and Drudgery are evil.? If you're not getting anything out of something at any point in this course, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time. We mean that. You won't hurt our feelings.

# Learning
Read this, it is a wonderful intro to the psychology of learning and where you are as a student <https://azeria-labs.com/the-process-of-mastering-a-skill/>.

We all want to better at learning... but how do we do that? 


Relevant Comic: <https://xkcd.com/1053/>

The most important thing to realize while you are on this journey is that you will never know everything, because nobody knows everything. All you can do is keep working at things and eventually, you will start understanding more because you have a strong foundation to build on. We are here to help you build that foundation.

# Brainwashing and Learning
## Brainwashing 

As we said before, hacking is a mindset, not a skillset. Sure you'll pick up plenty of useful skills along the way, but the primary benefit of the hacker mentality is being able to look at the world, see a problem you've never approached before, and figure out how to solve it. We are trying to cultivate that mindset, and yes, we are going to try to subtly brainwash you. We're not sorry about it. Genuine interest and drive are the two best indicators of success in this field, and we want to encourage it as much as we possibly can. How do we teach that? How do we measure that? We don't know. If we were pretentious losers we might say we're trying to hack your brain into becoming a hacker. But we're not. So lets call it brainwashing. Are you okay with being brainwashed?* 
 
 
 
 
 
* Note: This probably is not legally binding. 


## Continuous Learning

Learning this stuff isn't easy. The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up seemingly impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that. This course is intended to give you a general base of knowledge so that you can succeed with anything you do, but if you want to be great you have to love what you're doing and keep getting after it. For the rest of your time computering, maintain a series of lists. I recommend a Google Sheets file with a bunch of tabs. These are just a few I recommend, I'm sure you'll make more.

* Questions you don't know the search terms for
* Questions that google can't answer
* Things you want to learn how to do
* Things you want to learn more about
* Things you want to make or help make
* Things you want to tell other people about or write about
* Potential future reading material
* Links to things you want to remember

We will do our absolute best to help you keep these lists short. There will be section in the Slack for random questions, from ELI5 style to "Make me a tutorial", or you can always just private message it.

## Goals 

"Complete this course, as defined as finishing all the content that applies to me, before____________"

With most of the goal already defined for you, what you need to focus on is the timeline you want to set for yourself. 

Answer these questions:

1. How much time a week do you want to spend working on this? 
2. How much time a week do you think you will actually have to work on this?
3. When will you complete this course?

Submit your answers to these questions.

# Introduction
Read this: <https://web.archive.org/web/20170704130416/https://www.usna.edu/CyberDept/sy110/lec/risk/lec.html>

This link goes to part of a school's intro to cyber course. While that seems a little out of place, parts of that course are some of the best written material on the subject, and the DoD is one of the best in the world at managing risk.

1. Write a few sentences on the difference between Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk.
2. Write a few sentences on what makes the risk management tradeoff difficult.
3. What is the risk equation? 
4. Describe the risk management process


As an important legal note, we are not affiliated with that school, we just went there at one point.

[//]: # (7,52,activities/assign_52)
# Second Equation
Another, and more useful risk equation is Risk = (Threat x Vulnerability) Asset Value.
The addition of asset value lets us get a much better idea of what the impact would be.

So let's work through it again. Answer these questions in the submission box below.

1. What is a threat?
2. What is a vulnerability?
3. How do we define asset value?
4. What is the value added of the the second risk equation?
5. Ignoring the equations, how do you define risk?

# Risk Modeling
## Threat Modeling 

Read this: [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-mostly-and-love-my-threat-model/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-mostly-and-love-my-threat-model/)

Use this page to help assess what your risks are: [https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks)

What do you want to protect? Who do you want to protect it from? How likely is it that you will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if you fail? How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?

0. For this exercise, our list of things we are trying to protect will be your email account and your phone's photos. 
1. For each, write down where it?s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.
2. Think of three possible threat actors who might want to get a hold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation.
3. Think about what each adversary might want to do with your private data
4. Think about what the likelihood of each adversary coming for that data
5. Think about what happens to you if the adversary gets that data
6. Now try to answer the question, how much trouble are you willing to go through in order to prevent loss.
7. Delete everything you just wrote
8. Write a few sentences on why threat modeling is important
9. Undelete everything you just deleted if you did it electronically.
10. Write down who could have gotten to the list you just deleted
11. Make the decision of whether or not you need to delete the list you just made for yourself. If so, delete it. If you made it on Google Drive, good luck. This is a brain stretching exercise, so don't worry too much. 
12. What would it take for a hostile entity to capture what you just wrote down, depending on where you did it. Is it on a piece of paper, a local word document, a google doc? All of those require very different attacks.

One important note is that you might not have anything worth a targeted attack personally, but you have access to other things that might be interesting to other people. For example, your contact lists can be used to identify other, more important targets. Even more dangerous, someone could use your account to send phishes to your contacts. A @navy.mil address is going to have a significantly higher click rate than some random @gmail. You also have access to your network, so someone could use you to pivot to a network you have access to.

# Risk Assessment
A huge part of this training is providing you with the mental models required to think about security. By providing the general framework, you can fill in the gaps, or at least start working towards filling the gaps. But sometimes, mental models just don't cut it. You need something on paper, written in blood, that will help you do what you need to do in order to be successful. Risk assessment models give organizations a way to identify problems and address them in a quantitative and structured manner. There are a ton of them out in the wild, but the most important one for most people is NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This is the general framework that all DoD and .gov sites adhere to. There are other specific frameworks like ISO27001, CIS Critical Security Controls, HIPAA (health data), PCI DSS (credit cards and banking), and countless others but those don't matter much to you other than knowing they exist. A good knowledge of NIST will get you most of the way there. 

Tasks:

1. So many things to do here. 
2. Read this: [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/components-framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/components-framework)
3. Read this: [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions)
3. Write a few sentences about each of the different function categories. 
4. What does "Outcome Driven" mean?
5. Read this: [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/uses-and-benefits-framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/uses-and-benefits-framework)
6. Write a few sentences on how to use the framework to drive decision making.

You probably don't know much right now technically, but technical knowledge is meant to inform your decision making processes, and you can usually get along fairly well on a good mix of common sense and procedure.?Remember, frameworks are just frameworks, and are only as good as the person doing the assessment.

You're going to see these guy's names a lot, the paper where they introduced these ideas is widely regarded as the most cited paper in security. I am not having you read the paper they originally introduced them in as it is quite long, but if you are super interested you can read part A of this <http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/Basic.html>.

# Immutable Laws
First, immutable means "unchanging over time or unable to be changed". You'll see this word in various contexts throughout computing.The paper 10 Immutable Laws of Security is a seminal paper on why security is hard. 

Read this: <https://web.archive.org/web/20160315065346/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh278941.aspx?>

If you don't understand what any the laws mean, try to google around to figure it out.

# Cyber Killchain
So how has security adapted to face all these threats? Basically, the most modern idea is the idea of defense in depth, making it so the bad guys have to beat layer after layer of security in order to get in, and then back out. The go-to model is the cyber killchain by Lockheed Martin, and while it gets a ton of crap, it is honestly a very good way of looking at it.

<https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf>

Make sure you know the different layers of the killchain. 
Write a sentence describing each and provide three examples. If you can't think of examples, google for em. Don't worry too much about being right.

1. Recon
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command and Control
7. Actions on Objectives

---
[//]: # (7,62,activities/assign_62)
# Post-Exploitation
One of the most common arguments against the killchain is that "Actions on Objectives" is too vague. For one, all of the other steps of the killchain can occur as an action on objective if the attacker uses it to attack something else, which is known as pivoting. But there are many other "post-exploitation" objectives of an attacker, which range from installing backdoors to bricking the device. 

There are 5 P's of Post-Exploitation:

* Persistence = Find a way to maintain access 
* Privilege Escalation = Find a way to get a higher level of access than you already have
* Pilfer = Steal things
* Pillage = Break things. 
* Pivot = Move from one box to another and start the killchain all over again.

I will write a good post on this at some point, but for now, just try to remember what each of those things means. 

Task: 

Describe a hypothetical attack on a user via email, using your current understanding, from recon all the way through all the post exploitation possibilities. It is fine if you don't have the technical understanding, we are just trying to make sure you have the concepts down. You are going to look back at this scenario later in the course and do it again, once you have more technical concepts down.

# Pyramid of Pain
# Pyramid of Pain

So now we are able to identify specific actions, now it is time to break down how to make it hard for the attacker. Knowing the attacker's TTPs, is hard to do, and you really can't do attribution to a specific actor just using those. This is a good mental model of all the ways you can make it hard for the adversary, as well as identify who they might be. 

Read this: <http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html>

Tasks: 

1. For each level of the pyramid of pain, describe it in your own words, and provide the primary strength and weakness of each.
2. You might realize that tools and the first T in TTPs (Tools) are both on there. The primary difference is that tools is removing the adversary's ability to use a tool, while Tools is identifying the behavior caused by various tools that accomplish the same thing. Write a few sentences on what behavioral detection means and how it could work in some fancy startup. 
3. Write a few sentences on how you could use the items in the pyramid of pain to identify a threat group.

# Diamond Model
# Diamond Model

Alright, so now we are able to identify a specific actor's general profile and have made ourselves hardened targets. Now, how do we make correlations across various boxes, networks, and organizations? One helpful model for this is the Diamond Model. 

Read this: [https://digital-forensics.sans.org/summit-archives/cti_summit2014/The_Diamond_Model_for_Intrusion_Analysis_A_Primer_Andy_Pendergast.pdf](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/summit-archives/cti_summit2014/The_Diamond_Model_for_Intrusion_Analysis_A_Primer_Andy_Pendergast.pdf)

Tasks:

1. For each corner of the diamond, write a few sentences on what they are. 
2. Write a few sentences on how correlation between breaches can be done using the Killchain and the Diamond Model.
3. What is a threat group/activity group? (You may need Google)
4. Write a few sentences on how you can use these pieces of information to build an identity for an activity group.
5. Write about what the benefits are of creating a named threat/activity group

Read this: [https://www.secureworks.com/blog/advanced-persistent-threats-apt-a](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/advanced-persistent-threats-apt-a)

## APT 1 aka Unit 61398

You may have heard of other Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) by now, but here is the report that got it all started. It was the first report that publically named and provided TTPs (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures) and Indicators of Compromise (IOC), as well as identities of a threat group. Now everyone does it, but this is what got the ball rolling in threat intelligence. Google what TTPs and IOCs are.

There are a lot of ways for you to get hacked, so there is no way we can go over them all. 

But, we can go over good ways to think about this. 

This site goes over where all your vulnerabilities lie.

* Social Engineering
* Supply Chain
* Communications
* Software
* Physical Security
* Hardware

Tasks: 

1. For each of the domains of attack, describe in a few sentences what they are and how you can be attacked through them.
2. Describe what "attack surface" means to you.
3. Describe how you would minimize attack surface.

---
[//]: # (7,70,activities/assign_70)
# Mechanisms of Attack
Now we can think about how you get attacked in those domains in terms of attack mechanisms as seen here. This is a crazy useful resource that will require its own section someday. Once again made by the Mitre folk, a Federally funded research and development center or FFRDC. FFRDCs are a private-public partnership who do research for the .gov/.mil. Mitre people are awesome.


[https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html)

List of Attack Mechanisms:

* Collect and Analyze Information 
* Inject Unexpected Items 
* Engage in Deceptive Interactions 
* Manipulate Timing and State
* Abuse Existing Functionality
* Employ Probabilistic Techniques 
* Subvert Access Control 
* Manipulate Data Structures 
* Manipulate System Resources 

Task: 

For each attack mechanism, describe in two sentences what the thing being attacked is and how they generally work. This is going to take some research, but shouldn't take all that long. You can click to expand to learn more about each type of attack. 

---
[//]: # (7,71,activities/assign_71)
# Methods of Attack 
Building off of domains of attack, and mechanisms of attack, MITRE also created an unbelievable resource that provides a way of looking at how those mechanisms are applied to the various domains of attack. Unsurprisingly, it is called ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge). This is the real world, practical application of these theories and it lists out the many many many ways that bad guys get in.

[https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page)

This resource will take a prohibitively long time to go through, and honestly deserves its own course. But if you don't know what each of the items described in it means, you will be hurting in the long term. For now, it is a bunch of stuff that is good for you to have an understanding that they exist. 

We are going to have you read through all of this to help your brain understand what is possible. Consider it a crash course in evil.

Tasks:

1. For the items in Initial Access, write one sentence summarizing how the attack works. 
2. Execution has a lot of complicated things that do not require understanding yet. For now, just write one sentence for the following items:

* Exploitation for Client Execution
* Service Execution
* User Execution
* Script Execution (this is not it's own specific item, but you'll be able to figure it out)
* Operating System Execution (this isn't either)

3. Read through Persistence, but don't worry about understanding most of it. There's a lot of useful technical things in there, but this will help you see words and just familiarize yourself with it.
4. Same with Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, Command and Control.... this requires more work... but really just read it and ignore the things that don't make sense. It's good practice. 

Skip Pre-Attack for now. (https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Main_Page) It requires its own stuff, lot of work to do.

# Penetration Testing
Pen Test is short for penetration testing, which basically means breaking into someone's stuff in order to help make them more secure by identifying vulnerabilities and helping to fix them. In the civilian world, you can do this for a job. While the military has "red teams" which perform attacks on friendly networks to help make our defenses better, the rest of the military who does this kind of work usually doesn't tell the people they hack how to make their systems more secure....Mostly because those people have already had all their stuff stolen/been hit in the head with a hellfire missile/shot in the head by a SEAL. But I digress.

On the second page of this cool poster, learn about a sample network pen test.

For anything you do not understand, look it up. If looking up doesn't explain that specific item well in >5 minutes, add your question to your question list and write it at the bottom of your submission.

Task:

In your own words, describe what happened. Don't worry about getting it wrong for now, we'll teach you how to do this eventually. In addition, write out whatever questions you have about this and we'll answer them.

You will be doing this for a few more scenarios, the point of writing out how this happened is so we can help you if you misunderstand things, as well as answer your questions.

# Already Hacked
As we went over earlier, if a sufficiently advanced attacker wants to get into your stuff specifically, they will.

But we have looked at our threat model before and have determined we are probably not a person of interest to the NSA/Mossad/FSB, right? Right???

So according to our threat model, the most likely people to hack us will be random criminals who don't care who we are, they're just trying to get in. While it is an over simplification, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". If you are able to harden yourself ahead of time and not be an easy target, you will be much less likely to get hit with a non-targeted attack, and in the possibility that you ever are targeted, you will be more likely to not get caught off guard.

These are some of the most common of the reasons you might get hacked.
# You are already hacked!! 

The most common way to get malware on your computer is to already have malware on your computer. Seriously, as I was first writing this section, I ran a scan on my shared family computer I am using and removed 5 separate PUPs and 1 piece of adware. Shared computers, whether family, work, or libraries, are hot places for malware to be sitting on, and if you log in to a owned computer, you might just lose your passwords to a keylogger. So let's make sure you are not owned already and then set ourselves up to be safe in the future. 

## How Can You Tell
Remember the term indicators of compromise (IOC) from before?. There are a ton that can be used, some approaches more technical than others. Common non-techical indicators include constant pop ups, home page redirection, search engine redirection, the classic pile of toolbars, and the computer being slow and the fans working way too hard. Technical indicators include extra processes running, network requests, and things saved in places they shouldn't be. Looking for these technical indicators is called "Threat Hunting". It deserves its own section, but we will briefly go over a few ways you can identify the bad things on your computer.

[https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/05/how-to-tell-if-youre-infected-with-malware/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/05/how-to-tell-if-youre-infected-with-malware/)

# Anti-Virus
### Anti-Virus

This section will bring me some heat, because a lot of people in the security community don't believe that anti-virus is helpful. I disagree, mostly on the basis that while they only detect lowest hanging fruit malware, I don't want to be a lowest hanging fruit victim.

Basically, these companies execute the malware, break down the malware into tiny pieces and creates indicators for the different components and what the execution of them look like, so that they can identify them on your computer and completely delete them off. I recommend that you have Windows Defender running at all times for protection. There is no need to have any other anti-virus on your computer, more is not better. 

The only time I'd recommend you run a second antivirus is to remove an active adware or PUP infection as Windows Defender doesnt consider many of them malicious. (If you want to correct me on this, just hit me via any of my many contact methods.) 

Task:

0. Read this: [https://www.howtogeek.com/125650/htg-explains-how-antivirus-software-works](https://www.howtogeek.com/125650/htg-explains-how-antivirus-software-works/)
1. Download Malwarebytes and run it. [https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/)
2. Install Windows Defender, because it is built into your computer and really, really good. If it is installed, make sure it is running.
3. Uninstall Malwarebytes. You don't need it around all the time, just whenever you get on a new computer and once every couple months.

# Network Hunting
### Network Hunting

Continuing along the idea of threat hunting, we can use network traffic to identify evil.
If malware is on your network, it is going to try to talk out to its command and control server. There are plenty of ways to look at network traffic but I recommend the tool Glasswire and Wireshark for this purpose. Glasswire identifies processes making network connections and alerts on them. If the process doesn't make sense when it pops up, go to Wireshark and open up the stream to see if it makes sense.

Tasks:

1. Download Glasswire [https://www.glasswire.com/](https://www.glasswire.com/)
2. You already should have Wireshark downloaded. If not, download it.
3. Look at the Glasswire alerts. 
4. Choose one of the alerts for something that isn't a webbrowser and identify the stream in Wireshark.
5. Submit a screenshot of the data from Wireshark.

# You got Tricked
Alright so your computer is clean, probably, after following the last steps, now if you get infected in the future the most likely scenario is that you ran someone else's code and gave them access to your computer. There's nothing to feel bad about, this could have happened in many ways, and it happens to the best of us. Common ways this could have occured are online installers, phishing, and downloaded tools getting a malicious update. We will go over each method, and how to avoid it in the future. 


Downloaded Something Nasty

Downloading something nasty is the easiest way to do this, whether it is from an email, a big green download arrow on a website, or a program from a torrent site. Phishing is the most common, because it is the most targeted, which results in a higher install rate.

One of the biggest things you can do to avoid getting phished is to learn what a phishing attempt looks like. Read this: <https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/06/somethings-phishy-how-to-detect-phishing-attempts/>
Also, read this: <https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-avoid-phishing-attacks>

Now what do you do if someone tries to phish you, or you are wondering if this is a phishing attempt? Read this: <https://decentsecurity.com/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/>

If you get a phish, good chance other people are getting it as well. So you need to report it! Make sure you know how to report to your organization to protect everyone else!

You could have also run some backdoored shit, whether from an online download, or packaged in with real software. A good move before downloading anything is run it through these sites listed in the anti-phishing tools. These sites are pretty awesome and use a lot of cool technology to make a determination if something is malicious. 

Attachment and file checkers use something called a "sandbox" to open the file/execute the program. The sandbox monitors the process created and looks for any malicious behavior, in addition to running anti-virus looking for a known bad. 

URL checkers use a browser to visit the URL and look for malicious behavior, like attempts at infection using an exploit. They also usually provide historical information about the website and if it has been used to host malware before.

IP Checkers look at historical data for an IP address or block of IP addresses to see if they have been used for shady things in the past. Remember the difference between and IP and a URL?

Tasks: 

1. Write a few sentences on why a URL could be clean historically but the IP address could be bad. This is going to require your understanding of hosting servers and domain names. 
2. Analyze a malicious attachment using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it.
3. Analyze a malicious program using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it.
4. Analyze a malicious URL using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it.
5. Analyze an IP using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it.
6. Read this: <https://www.digitalcitizen.life/uac-why-you-should-never-turn-it-off>. 
7. Turn UAC all the way up. Write what is UAC and why it protects you from malware.
8. How does malware bypass UAC, other than getting a human to enter the password? (Hint: Mitre Attack) There are a few answers, google around.

# Outdated Extensions and Permissions

A long time ago, you might have used a FB addon that made cool faces on your profile picture, or a Chrome calendar extension that allowed you to remember your mom's birthday. Well, now the original coders got bored and sold it to some shit ass criminals who are using it to steal your shit. At one point they were good, now they are bad, and you need to get them off your shit. Most of the time, Malwarebytes can catch extensions on your computer, or Chrome will identify them as bad. Identifying evil browswer extensions will almost always be caught by the browser developers before you realize.

However, you still gotta get the addons and permissions out of your accounts.

All of these tasks are Googleable. 

Tasks:
1. Check email for devices you have given permissions to.
2. Check email for services you have given permissions to
3. Check FB for addons
4. Check Twitter for addons
5. Check any other sites you can think of for addons.

# Malware Removal
We are about to get philosophical. Remember how we were just talking about how there is straight up, NO possible way for us to know if your computer is owned? Well we are about to get into the exact same problem, but now for cleaning your computer. If you have evidence that a malicious program ran on your computer, you can never trust this computer ever again. That tiny PUP that kept changing your homepage to some Chinese marketplace could have been bundled with some nation state rootkit that overwrote your computer's foundational code down at the soul of the device and you aren't going to be able to remove that malware unless you return the silicon into sand.  

However, that is very, very, very unlikely. As we have said before, you are not going to be targeted by nation states, or really anyone at all. If you get hacked, almost certainly by an untargeted attack, the malware will drop itself off, establish persistence, and then do its thing. While there have been examples in the past of standard malware going for rootkit persistence, that is significantly more difficult on modern operating systems. 99% of the time, if antivirus identifies the malware and removes it, you are good and don't have to worry about any follow on problems. Sure, that does leave room for the next 1%, so my recommendation is remove the malware, let that computer chill for a day or two if you can afford to use another, and then run the malware scan again. If you keep finding malware you have a bigger problem, but the rest of the time, you can just go back to using the computer as normal. It is no life to buy a new computer every time you mess up, and it gets expensive fast.

So with all that said, if you use your computer for nuclear launch codes, critical intellectual property, or managing the crypto wallets of your hoarded wealth in addition to casual internet surfing, don't destroy the pwned computer. Buy a new computer to do your serious business, and then clean up the old one as best you can and use the old computer to surf the web. Compartmentalization is key. 

## So how do I get it clean again? 

Can't do better than this guide. 
<https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/06/10-easy-steps-to-clean-your-infected-computer/>
I might get some heat from some corners for recommending a specific malware remover, but hell, its Malwarebytes or Kaspersky and I'm not big on Russians.

Also, go to a clean computer and change all of your passwords immediately. Allllll of them.

## What would happen if the malware doesn't all get deleted on the first run? 

If all the malware is still there, it means that the anti-virus you're using isn't very good, or that the malware is pretty good. Maybe both. Either way, you are not good enough to go and manually delete everything you need to delete the malware yourself, so best bet is don't use the computer for a few days, then try and delete it again using your tools after their signatures get updated. Think about it this way, if a piece of malware gets by your anti-virus' signatures, there is a good chance that it is somewhat new. If you got hacked by it in an untargeted attack, most likely many other people did as well. This will lead to the anti-virus company identifying the malware as persistent and then analyzing it to identify what it is missing in the first clean. Then they will update the signatures and have a more effective removal process the next time. If the malware's persistence mechanism is so good you, Windows, and Malwarebytes still can't beat it, your best move is to reinstall the operating system. This will work in most cases, though there is a small chance of a rootkit/bookit or worse, firmware malware persisting across OS installs. If this happens... get your computer to someone who can get it to the NSA because that's some high quality shit. They'll probably give you a sticker or something. 

## Repeat Attack Vectors

If you removed the malware, but you keep getting new malware a week or two later, and you are confident it isn't persistent, you need to figure out how you keep getting hit. 
* Patching
     * If you haven't patched, you are still vulnerable! You should have auto update on.
* Attachments
     * If you, or someone else keeps getting hit with attachments/etc, they need some user training
* Pirated Software
     * If you keep downloading pirated shit, you will keep getting popped. That is just how it goes.
* Porn Popups 
     * Same shit, stop going on sketchy porn sites and downloading things.
* It could be persistent and just sleeps for a week upon install
     * Reinstall your OS

# Passwords
# You used a shitty password 
<https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords>
 
Passwords are hard, and losing your primary email can pretty much stop your life as you attempt to regain control. Luckily, there is a lot you can do to keep yourself from becoming the low hanging fruit. After this section, not only will you be able to protect yourself, but you?ll be able to share this with others.

Tasks:

1. Read this: <http://www.passwordanalytics.com/theory/passwords/>
2. Read Passwords 101 and submit one example each of the three ways you authenticate yourself.
3. Read Good Passwords 101 and submit a description of what makes a good password
4. Read Strength 101 and submit a description of what makes a strong password
5. Read Pass-Phrase and describe how pass phrases balance being a good password and a strong password.
6. Read Cracking and explain which technique an attacker would use to attack a password that they knew to be 6 random alpha numeric characters
7. Read Cracking and explain which technique an attacker would use to attack a password that they knew to be three random words added together.
8. Read this and follow interesting links: <https://web.archive.org/web/20170704130144/https://www.usna.edu/CyberDept/sy110/lec/cryptHashPswd/lec.html>
9. <https://xkcd.com/936/>

Here is a brief experiment for you to try. Try to make a rough guess how many web sites you use on a regular basis use your primary email as their account recovery address. Now, try to think about which of those sites are the most important to you that they remain secure; social media, banking, other email accounts. Now think of the sketchy sites you reuse the same password on. If those sketchy sites are breached, and the attacker gets your password, they can try it against your email. If they get your email, they can use it to take your other accounts. This is called "password stuffing".

# Password Manager
All is not lost however, luckily you do not have to memorize hundreds of high entropy passwords or carry them around in a locked diary. Password managers provide the ability to generate and store secure passwords across devices, all controlled by a single master password. This means you only need to know one password, and the rest can be pseudo-randomly generated. 

Tasks:

1. Read this: <https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/>
2. Submit a 2-3 sentence statement trying to convince my grandma to use a password manager.
3. Relevant XKCD <https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936#Explanation>
What password has 2^44 bits of entropy?
4. Install LastPass <https://lastpass.com/>
5. Make your password for Lastpass something you have never used before. Now that everything will be stored in the same location, you need to protect your lastpass. Write this password down in a variety of places that you will not lose. Or just remember it. I recommend writing it down.
6. Make a new gmail account with a good password.
7. Setup your Lastpass to be recoverable through this email account only, not your usual account.
8. Never use this new email for anything else ever again other than 
9. Complete the LastPass Security challenge

# Multi-Factor Authentication
Tasks: 

1. Read this: <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs513/2005fa/NNLauthPeople.html>
2. What is the definition of multi factor auth?
3. What does multi factor provide?
4. What does it not provide?
5. Download GoogleAuth 
6. Enable Multifactor on your Lastpass Account. Read through the options <https://www.lastpass.com/multifactor-authentication> and see what the different varieties are.
7. Enable Multifactor on your GitHub
8. From a risk perspective, do you really need multifactor on your github?
9. Remove multifactor from your Github
10. Put multifactor on whatever other accounts you think deserve that level of protection. <https://twofactorauth.org/>
11. Read this: <https://web.archive.org/web/20180422212245/https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/how-yubikey-works/>

You could probably get a couple, and then set it up with <https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/>. Google's Advanced Protection is the best you can get right now, but you probably don't need it. My philosophy is I can't properly tell people to do things for their security if I don't do it myself and understand the pain points. For the record, I don't use it. Too inconvenient when I'm on a ship and can't log in to things. 

A brief note: Cell phone text messagesaka SMS are commonly used for multifactor auth. These are not great, because 
a) someone can steal your phone number and get the texts sent to them  <https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/>
b) intercept of text messages <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/ss7-hack-explained-mobile-phone-vulnerability-snooping-texts-calls>

However, those things are not in your threat model unless you are famous or have cryptocurrency wallets.

Another note: Just because you have 2 factor doesn't mean you can't get phished for it!

# Security Questions and Account Resets
What is your mother?s maiden name? First dog? Elementary school? All of those things are fairly easy to find online, or just from casual conversation. If someone is trying to steal an account, that will always be the easiest route. Security questions are hard to avoid, but there are easy ways to harden yourself and protect your accounts.
 
Tasks: 

* Read this: <https://www.wired.com/2016/09/time-kill-security-questions-answer-lies/>
* Submit what the article recommends you do

Luckily, there is a better way. Instead of forcing you to lie, we are going to introduce you to the ideas of hashing and salting.

### Hashing and Salting

Tasks:

* Read this: <https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm>. Not all of it, unless you really want to, just enough to answer these questions.
* In 2-3 sentences explain hashing and why it is important
* Describe each of the ways passwords are cracked
* In 2-3 sentences, explain what salting does and why it is important.

Combining the ideas of salting and hashing, now learn how you are going to make secure security questions! First, as a rule, don't use uppercase letters, spaces, or punctuation ever in your security questions. Why? Nothing about security, it just makes them easier to remember. Then if we take a hashing algorithm, like MD5, and a unique salt, such as ?salty17?, we can use the function MD5(_answer_to_question_ + ?salty17?). This will create a very very hard to figure out security question that you can easily use anywhere. 

Or, if you are on a computer with your password manager, just write that shit down in your secure notes for a site. If they get your lastpass account you are screwed anyway, so don't worry about it.

# More Password Stuff
# You Got Phished For Your Password

You can always get tricked with a good email or malicious link that leads you to a login page. Always, always, always, always look at the full URL. Green locks and any other bells and whistles won't help you. But.... there is always a small chance that your DNS is being hijacked and the URL is right, in which case your browser will tell you that the HTTPS key has changed. Long story short, use chrome, listen to your browser and think. It's happened to me, it might happen to you, just don't lose your email account, or your password manager. 

There is more information on this you have already gotten. 

# Someone else got popped

Tasks:

* Read this: <https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs>
* Sign up for haveIbeenpwned with all of your emails, especially older ones
* See if anything has ever been leaked!? 

# Default Passwords

There are a lot of default passwords out there in the world. You can use them to get free wifi, but the bad guys can use them too. 

Routers, Internet of Things devices, and web applications are common victims of default passwords. 
If you have the ability to change the password, change the password. If you don't change the defaults, you are begging to get added to a botnet, or worse. 

If you ever install an application and it has a default password, change that shit.

# Hostile Networks Intro
# Hostile Networks
## Intro
Add this to the list of security truisms.

"Any network connected to the internet must be considered hostile." Most intranets should be considered hostile too. In fact, it is hard to imagine a more "hostile" network than a DoD network.

But what does "hostile" mean? In this case, the general idea is that if computer A wishes to communicate with computer C, that means that they need to send all of their traffic through computer B. Gentleman's agreements not to look at that traffic might have worked on Arpanet, but not anymore.

From Internet Service Providers (ISPs) working with governments to snoop on all your traffic, to deep sea submarine cable intercepts to sketchy free wifi hotspots, your internet browsing is recorded by a lot of people. And when I mean, a lot of people, I mean literally every single hop on your way across the internet (remember traceroute?) will have a complete log of your connections. They might not have the content if you have encrypted your traffic, but they will have records of the date/time the request was made, from who, and to where. This is accesssible to anyone with access to the logs, whether they own it, pwned it, or have a court order. Your IP address is likely shared, but if logs are kept all the way down, and they likely do exist, anything can be tracked down to you.

This next section skips over the technical details of network ownage (while giving you plenty to research on your own time), and focuses on the principles that can protect you and specific steps you can take to protect yourself.


# They got your IP address

First, let's get into threat modeling... If you are doing something so 'fun' that if someone was able to provably demonstrate that you were the one behind the keyboard at the time you would go to jail or worse, this is the most important of all the sections. But you hopefully don't fall into this category, and more likely are worried about online censorship, aka web content filters. That's how I started. 

So while we mostly care about circumventing censorship, we will also teach as if you had to care about bad guys getting your IP address. 

It's a good thing to know.

[//]: # (8,99,activities/page_99)
# Protect Your IP
If you make a request to a website or send/receive any data across the internet, you have given your router's IP address. This request can take any form, from a visiting a link, viewing an image hosted there, or being redirected through a short link. You can also be tricked into opening a file that sends a request out to the internet, running a program which profiles your computer and sends out a request, or even running a terrible DDOS tool that makes no attempt to hide that it is running on your own network. An attacker can use these requests to identify someone through a 3rd party service. 
 
 Tasks:

 * Visit <http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/>
 * How much information did they know about you?
 * Use this site to shorten a URL and get your IP <https://iplogger.org/shortener/>?
 * Use this site to create a hidden image to get your IP. Send it to yourself via email. <https://iplogger.org/invisible/>. 
 * Visit: <https://canarytokens.org/generate> and make various tokens to be used for getting IP addresses and try them on yourself
    * Word Document 
    * Custom Image
    
 
 Now to add what is called a proxy. Basically, this is a server you send a request to that routes all the traffic through them first, then passes it on to you. The critical thing to remember is that this extra hop added by the proxy, although it obfuscates your IP from the end target, does not hide it from the servers providing the service. They can see all of your traffic, and can do whatever they want with it. Your extra hops will create logs, and all those logs can still be used if someone gets them.
 
Tasks:

* Visit <https://hide.me/en/proxy>
* Use their proxy to visit <http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/>
* How much information do they have about you now?

Adding an extra hop works, but it needs to be done intelligently, and certainly not through a sketchy website which provides it for free. Don't use free proxies, because if the product is free.... you are the product.

# IP Protections
## Hiding Your IP and Circumventing Censorship


So now we know we need to add something in between ourselves and the things we are trying to visit. There are a varieties of ways to do that, but the most important bit is that we are able to trust the hops we are using, because a malicious hop is almost as bad as no hop at all. 

First, some vocab.

* Port Forward
* Proxy
* Proxychains
* VPNs
* TOR
* Dark Web
* Deep Web

 * <https://danielmiessler.com/study/internet-deep-dark-web>
 
 Tasks: 
1. Define all the vocab words.
 
       
## Circumventing Proxies and Going Right to the Source

Remember honey tokens? Or just malware. That calls home real nice. There's also a fine line in the middle refered to by some as a "Network Investigative Tool" which is basically just a system profiler that calls home and deletes itself.

## What Can Be Done with an IP

   * Identify general location 
   * DDOS their router 
   * Hack their Router
   * Court orders to ISPs
   * Threaten to give it to police so they can go get a court order

# Man in the Middle
What is a man in the middle attack? You may have heard this before, and you'll hear it plenty more as it is the easiest and most common network attack.

The general idea is that if Computer A tries to communicate with Computer C, but their conversation transits over Computer B, B is able to read and even alter the messages being sent. This can allow Computer B to impersonate both people to each other and have them each receive a totally incorrect message while never knowing that they are being listened in on. This was not a huge problem back in the '70s on ARPANET, but now, when there are dozens of hops between your computer and whatever website you visit, any of those could be intercepting your traffic (and mostly likely multiple are).

Once again, the academy's piece on this is pretty damn good. Of course, we'll be going into this deeper later and you will do it yourself, but it's a good speed intro.

<https://web.archive.org/web/20170704130114/https://www.usna.edu/CyberDept/sy110/lec/cryptSymmEnc/lec.html>

Questions:

1. Of CIA, what were the pillars that can be attacked if an adversary is able to do a man in the middle?
2. In the Computer A,B and C scenario, what are the human names which match up to them?
3. This one requires a google, but who is Mallory, and what makes her different from Eve?
4. How does your browser protect you from MITM attacks? This will require a google.

## How to Be Safe
* Use a VPN/proxy/tor
* Basic wifi safety
    * Use a VPN!
    * Open WiFi vs. secure WiFi

# OPSEC
# OPSEC is king

If someone has found you in real life, the game is over. There are all sorts of great technical approaches to protecting yourself we have gone over already, but technology only goes so far. There is always a log created digitally and if a motivated attacker wants you, they will get you technically. OPSEC is what keeps you off the radar, and if you are going to be on the radar, gives them a cold trail and a fake account to chase into the ground. If you follow these rules, you will do much better towards not getting arrested. 

## What is OPSEC?

Tasks:

1. Submit what is the OPSEC Purple Dragon
2. Check out the fingerprinter at Panopticlick: [https://panopticlick.eff.org](https://panopticlick.eff.org)
3. Read this: [https://gizmodo.com/5901430/these-breasts-nailed-anonymous-hacker-in-fbi-case](https://gizmodo.com/5901430/these-breasts-nailed-anonymous-hacker-in-fbi-case)

# Compartmentalization
Tasks:

* Listen to the 10 Crack Commandments: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYb_8MM1tGQ>
* Read this: <https://medium.com/@thegrugq/operational-security-and-the-real-world-3c07e7eeb2e8>
* Submit the reasoning behind compartmentalization. You've already determined your risk model, so compartmentalization only matters as much as your risk model requires. 
* Read This: <http://blogsofwar.com/hacker-opsec-with-the-grugq/>
* Read this: <https://gist.github.com/grugq/353b6fc9b094d5700c70>
* Identify which of these things you have not done yet and do them.
* Read Grugq's Commandments: <https://grugq.tumblr.com/post/60463307186/rules-of-clandestine-operation>

* Listen to the 10 Hack Commandments: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8ILq1a_yw>. It's by a guy called Dual Core, makes some pretty dope stuff for a rapper who writes for nerds. His number one song is 'Drink All the Booze, Hack All the Things' <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y>. Let's put it this way, hackers don't take themselves all that seriously, and they can do some pretty cringey shit. If you listen to the lyrics to 'Hack All the Things' you will probably understand about one third of the references, at best. If you don't like it or are too cool for nerdcore rap, that's fine. If you stick around eventually you'll understand most of it and you'll go nuts when someone throws it on during a late night hack sesh after you've been passing around a bottle of whiskey.

If you have the time, these are all highly recommended, if not, add them to your 'Read At Some Point' tab in the Learning Sheet:

* Hacker OPSEC talk: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU>

# Physical Attacks
# Physical attacks

A physical attack on your computer, called an "Evil Maid", is a classic attack and near impossible to defeat. If someone has hands on keyboard after stealing your device, they own that computer unless you have protected it properly. If you have protected it properly and someone modifies the hardware, then you use it, then you are still screwed. If someone has you and the computer, you are screwed. Long story short, it is better for them to not know you are worth attacking, thus, OPSEC. However, sometimes you can't do that. Maybe you are a high profile individual who is in a hotel, maybe you live in a government dorm, maybe you are traveling and get border searched. This is the guide for those times. 

Tasks:

* Read this: <http://images.secure.f-secure.com/Web/FSecure/%7B319382b2-a040-4c88-bd94-20eed01bf22f%7D_F-Secure-Evil-Maid-Guide.pdf>
* Where does an evil maid attack fall into your personal threat model?

You can also mount an encrypted partition in your OS, and use that to hold a virtual machine to do your important work on. That gives you a ton of deniability, especially with the ability to make multiple partitions that unlock to different passwords. Remember though, if you get hacked on the outside, you get hacked in the VM as well. Either way, you need FDE and secure boot if you want to beat an evil maid.

Alright, now that you know that you need FDE and Secure Boot, lets go into various physical attacks on a computer and defenses against them.

1. Tackling you off of the computer while logged in
        * You can try a quick shutdown
	* Read about Cold Boot attacks
	    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack>
	    * While this sounds hard, I've done one before in a controlled environment. Actually pretty easy.
	    
2. Breaking in to your hotel room and installing a keylogger, then breaking back in later and stealing your laptop now that they have the password. Or just arresting you.
        * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-bag_cryptanalysis>
	* Classic Boot attack
	* Installing keylogger
	
3. Malicious hardware to a turned on computer
	* USB Malware
	       * BAdusb
	       * Rubberducky
	       * BashBunny
	* FIREWIRE
	* Turn off your computer when you leave 
	
4. User Introduced Attacks
	* Hardware intercepts
	  	* Some chips will get intercepted en route, replaced/modified, and sent to their final destination
	* Backdoored chips
		* Some chips will come off the assembly line with backdoors in them already

4. Malicious hardware to turned off compter
        * Throw a new chip on your computer
	* Keylogger in keyboard
	* NSA Playset: <http://www.nsaplayset.org/chuckwagon>
	
4. Electronic Emissions
        * Read this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking>
	
5. Taking you and your computer and forcing you to give up password
	* "Rubber hose cryptography"
		* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis>
		* <https://xkcd.com/538/>
        * Some encryption tools allow the possibility of multiple partitions, so that multiple passwords can be used. Only one password unlocks what you are actually trying to hide, others open different partitions, and there is no way of proving that there are multiple partition/password pairs... this doesn't work very well legally, but might work. A little bit. 
	    * Legal issues surrounding forced password disclosure
              * There is more constitutional law in this field than you ever expected. Further on courses will discuss how all this plays together but:
	      * Basically, US you are good, plead the 5th, self-incrimination. You'll still probably go down, but not for what is on the hard drive.
	      * Europe, you are going to jail
	      * Most other countries, jail
	      * "Not chill" countries, beaten until you give it up, then jail
	      
	* Biometrics
	   * If your device unlocks with anything on your body, they can just take you and open your stuff. 
	   * Fingerprint/retina/voice/face unlocks are not protected by Constitution, they can just make you unlock these things if they have you. 

# Lockpicking
Lockpicking and other security bypass techniques are very popular in the community, for obvious reasons. Many conferences have lockpick competitions and plenty of people carry picks around, because there is nothing worse than getting locked out of things you are allowed access to, but don't have a key.

Read this: <https://www.art-of-lockpicking.com/how-to-pick-a-lock-guide/>. 
At some point we will figure out getting lockpicks to participants so that they can practice.

# Linux Password Reset
Now you are going to do a password reset on your VM.
This will be the same for the vast majority of Linux VMs, but a general rule is that you can just Google how to do it for the VM you are on.

This one is generally known as a Grub Bootloader attack. 

Here is a starting point. <https://itsfoss.com/how-to-hack-ubuntu-password/>

Write a couple sentences about what you learned from this.

# Windows Password Reset
Now its time for Windows!
This literally works on every single version of Windows, and every Windows computer you have ever been on.

This one is generally known as the stickykeys or "sethc" reset. You'll figure out why that is.

Here is a starting point.
<https://www.top-password.com/blog/reset-windows-10-password-with-sticky-keys/>

One interesting note is that you might have to boot into safe mode for the stickykeys login as Windows Defender does interesting things. 

This link will bring you to the actual way to do this. <https://www.top-password.com/knowledge/reset-windows-10-password.html>

Write a couple sentences about what you learned from this.
