# Questions
Alright, you probably didn't expect this line of questioning in this course, and yet, here we are. Serious business time, three quick questions.

1. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?

2. Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? If so, have you thought about how you might do this? 

3. In the past three months, have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, visit <https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/> or call 1-800-273-8255. 

If you don't want to talk to a stranger, my name is Dennis, text or call me at 914-299-7537, email me, or message me on here. As an important note, I am not in your chain of command, so my interpretation is that I am not required to report any conversations I have. If anyone disagrees, let me know. 

It's okay to not be okay, talk to someone.
