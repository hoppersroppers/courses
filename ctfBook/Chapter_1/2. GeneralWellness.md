# GeneralWellness
#### Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously
   * You should be going to the bathroom every 2-4 hours
   * Caffeine, and especially drinks like coffee and energy drinks dehydrate you 

#### Sleep
   * Everyone loves bragging about being a hardo and sleeping four hours a night for months on end... guess what? It's not just stupid, it's actively hurting you in a variety of ways

#### Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink Monsters as your only sustenance for the day. Order in some Chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be pizza. 
   * Cook your own food every once in a while. Instant ramen doesn't count. Cooking is fun as hell. Do it. 

#### Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death. Getting your heart rate elevated for a few minutes a day is good for you, full stop. Do it. 
   * Even if the PRT is cancelled you should still work out. 
   * Looking for great resource for this, please recommend one if you have it. 

####  Neurodiversity
   * Hackers are known for our neurodiversity, and our brains let us do amazing things, but sometimes they work in ways that don't always make the most sense to us and the people around us. Here are some resources to help understand what you or other people experience every day.

  * If you have questions about medication, talk to your command's doc to get a referral to Mental Health. It's a process but it's worth it. 

#### Mental Health
   * The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun, but it is worth having all the resources you can. Read all of these. Help yourself or help your friends.
