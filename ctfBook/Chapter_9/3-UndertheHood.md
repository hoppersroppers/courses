# Under the Hood
I know someone on the internet is going to be upset I am recommending Chrome for this. Sorry. I like it. If you are used to using some other browser's Dev Tools, then you don't need to do this section.

* Also known as 'dev tools', all browsers come with the ability to view the behind the scenes of a webpage as it loads. Chrome's dev tools are amazing. Again, sorry internet randoms, I don't feel bad recommending Chrome over Firefox.
