Then decrypt this: "Iuhtxhqfb dqdobvlv lv wkh vwxgb ri wkh glvwulexwlrq ri wkh ohwwhuv lq d whaw.

Most automated cryptography tools use this sort of technique behind the scenes. 

Another example is the chi-squared statistic: <http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/chi-squared-statistic/>

Crypto has a lot of math, but luckily, because it is math, someone else has usually written a tool to do it for you. It takes a lot of work to get to the cutting edge in this field.
