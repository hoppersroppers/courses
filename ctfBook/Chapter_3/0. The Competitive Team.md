# The Competitive Team
When you sign up for this site, you automatically become a member of our not-at-all competitive team, which also happens to be named Hopper's Roppers. This whole site is grown out of the training I made for my college security team who competed in various cyber security competitions. Now, Hopper's Roppers is a distributed team, open to anyone, but is especially meant to be a place for beginners to learn the ropes in and we will participate in any event we have the numbers for. You will not be ready to compete while you are still working your way through this course... the good news, is you don't need to be ready to compete to do it. All you have to do is sign up, know your brain is going to hurt and you probably won't understand anything, and be ready to learn. 

There is no better measure of ability, grit, and the hacker mentality than playing in a competition. Every CTF requires you to use what you already know to identify what you will need to learn on the spot to solve the problem. As you are now a member of our team, we will let you know when competitions are occurring and we hope to see you there if you have the time. Even if you are new and don't think you have anything to contribute, you will learn more picking someone's brain as you shoulder-surf them (or watch them on Twitch) than you possibly could trying to learn by yourself.
