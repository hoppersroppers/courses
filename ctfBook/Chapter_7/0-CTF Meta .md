Forensics can include a number of elements mixed together such as:

* Network (pcap files or other traffic logs)
* Recon (identifying random things, people, locations)
* Anti-forensic techniques



When looking through a network challenges, there are a few basic types of challenges you can expect to see.

1. A file is transferred
2. A conversation occurs between two addresses
3. A hidden channel is used to send information
4. Something occurred and you must follow a series of events to get to the final answer

These challenges often involve adding another level of work beyond the initial discovery of the communication, whether adding stego, encoding, encryption or a custom network protocol.

The most important thing to do in the majority of these challenges is to identify the attacked host, the attacking host, and then find the channel in between.
