# tShark
tShark is a command line tool to do the same things that Wireshark does. It is pretty awesome and allows you to script complex activities that you could never do in Wireshark. tShark should be your go to tool to solve these sort of problems.

Follow this tutorial: <https://hackertarget.com/tshark-tutorial-and-filter-examples/>

To create your initial pcap, run the command "tshark -i wlan0 -w capture-output.pcap" and then visit <https://hoppersroppers.org> and <http://zombo.com/>.

Then continue through the rest of the tutorial using the pcap you recorded.
