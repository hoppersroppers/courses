RFCs or Request for Comments, is the way that the internet develops standards. Read this to learn more: <https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-request-for-comments-rfc-4092366> We talked about them a bit in the Representing Data section.

* Skim the HTTP RFC to answer a few questions: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt>
