# Compete and Learn
Our goal throughout this course was to teach you the most essential skills and introduce you the most important resources so that you are able to solve problems in a CTF by yourself. All the words, concepts, and tools we have introduced have led you to this point.

Now you are going to go compete in the 2019 picoCTF!

<https://2019game.picoctf.com/> 

This competition runs year round and is organized by some of our friends. With the knowledge you have from this course you should be able to crush it!

Keep us informed of your progress, let us know any time that you get stuck. We are here to support and will be asking you as well.

Make sure you document your work and take good notes so that you can create your own writeups for others to learn from.

Good luck!

I might do something where I have you submit screenshots of your score every 5 challenges you solve, and then have you do writeups of n challenges.
