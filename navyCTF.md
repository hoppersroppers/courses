Secure Yourself Now


You signed up for this course to improve yourself, to learn how to secure yourself online, and to help others. That's what this section is dedicated to. If you finish this section and don't do anything else, your participation in this course will be a success in my eyes. Maybe not in your chain of command's but that's a completely different story.

Of course, I would prefer you to continue in the course, but I'm glad you are here, and I hope you stick around.

You're working from home, off your personal computer, so first, congratulations on all the bandwidth. You are all security professionals, so I know I don't have to drive this point home too hard, but the computers that you defend and maintain at work are significantly more secure than the one you are accessing this course from. You know everything I am about to tell you, but I'm going to tell you it again.

Your first assignment is to start using a password manager.  Read this <https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/> to learn about password managers, and then install one, I  recommend <https://lastpass.com/>. There's plenty of other password managers out there, but I've been using this one forever and that is the only reason I recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers. If you don't want to do this now, skip it, I make sure you do it later in the course.

Your second task, if you do not already have one installed, is to install an ad-blocking extension. For Chrome, I recommend uBlock Origin: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en>. I don't use Firefox, but it's a good browser, especially for the more privacy conscious. I also recommend installing Chrome (or Firefox) and ad-blockers on as many computers of friends and family that you do tech support for. If you don't want to do this now, skip it, I make sure you do it later in the course.

I'd like to think you don't already have malware on your computer but if you are working off of a shared family computer, there's a decent chance if you haven't checked recently. First, ensure that Windows Defender is enabled. If it isn't, turn it on. After you've done that, turn on automatic updates and ensure your computer is completely updated. If it isn't, update now. Once again, do this on as many computers as you are responsible for. You do it at work, do it home. If you're not on Windows, good luck not downloading malware you 1337 hardo. You'll probably be fine.

I know this stuff is obvious, but it's easy to be complacent when we get home. We know what best practices are, so do them.

Computer Related Health


You probably spend a ton of time in front of a computer at work, but now that you're at home, your setup might not be what it was. If you're going to be working through this course, competing in our CTF, or binging Netflix, these are a few changes you can constantly put into practice that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Ergonomics
* Read this: <https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169>
1. Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an investment. If you have a laptop, find a keyboard and mouse and set the laptop up on top of books to get it to the right height when you are sitting down. Try to avoid having a laptop on your lap, get it on a table and sit in a chair.

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.
* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can download this and it will change your life. <https://justgetflux.com/>
   * Windows has this option by default now, so check for that before downloading flux.
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses, they should be pretty cheap (>$30). I swear by mine, but hey, whatever, it keeps my eyes from hurting when I am about to spend 12 hours scrolling packet captures.

General Wellness



#### Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously.
   * Read this: <https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/quest-for-hydration#1>

#### Sleep
   * Everyone loves bragging about being a hardo and sleeping four hours a night for months on end... guess what? It's not just stupid, it's actively hurting you in a variety of ways.
    * <https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-deprivation-and-deficiency>

#### Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink Monsters as your only sustenance for the day. Order in some Chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be pizza.
   * Cook your own food every once in a while. Instant ramen doesn't count. Cooking is fun as hell. Do it.

#### Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death. Getting your heart rate elevated for a few minutes a day is good for you, full stop. Do it.
   * Even if the PRT is cancelled you should still work out.
   * Looking for great resource for this, please recommend one if you have it.

####  Neurodiversity
   * Hackers are known for our neurodiversity, and our brains let us do amazing things, but sometimes they work in ways that don't always make the most sense to us and the people around us. Here are some resources to help understand what you or other people experience every day.
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml>
  * <https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adhd-attention-deficit-disorder-in-adults.htm>
  * If you have questions about medication, talk to your command's doc to get a referral to Mental Health. It's a process but it's worth it.

#### Mental Health
   * The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun, but it is worth having all the resources you can. Read all of these. Help yourself or help your friends.
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml>
  * <https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/index.shtml>

There is a group named the Mental Health Hackers who are pretty cool and worth a look  <https://twitter.com/hackershealth>.

Questions


Alright, you probably didn't expect this line of questioning in this course, and yet, here we are. Serious business time, three quick questions.

1. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?

2. Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? If so, have you thought about how you might do this?

3. In the past three months, have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, visit <https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/> or call 1-800-273-8255.

If you don't want to talk to a stranger, my name is Dennis, text or call me at 914-299-7537, email me, or message me on here. As an important note, I am not in your chain of command, so my interpretation is that I am not required to report any conversations I have. If anyone disagrees, let me know.

It's okay to not be okay, talk to someone.

Why?


You thought you were here to learn how to get better at computers so what is all this?

Well, hopefully your end goal of all this is that you become a better person and have a better life. If you want to be good at computers just for the sake of being good at computers that counts for something too, but to me, all this technology is just a way for me to accomplish more than I could by myself.

If you're going to be doing anything in this world, might as well take care of yourself first. Learning security comes far after you and your well-being.

Now, on to the show!

Letter from the Author


## Dedication
This training is dedicated to the memories of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), [Bassel Khartabil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil) and those named on the [National Cryptologic Memorial](https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/cryptologic-memorial/cryptologic-memorial-list.shtml).

## Letter from the Author
After a decade of teaching myself how to use computers and a few years training others, I went and made the site that I wish had existed when I got into the field back in middle school.

Security is the shield of the modern world, and we need good people on the wall.  Thanks for being up there.

Why Security


This course is meant to give you the skills and more importantly, the mindset required to be successful in this line of work. If you already are successful, time to get better.

The only way to be good at anything in this field is to become comfortable looking at problems you have never seen before and then finding a way to solve what you are up against. This curriculum is not meant to turn you into a guru, but rather it is to provide you with a solid base of knowledge and mental models relating to security, as well as build your comfort level installing new programs, following tutorials for things you have never heard of before, and using the Linux operating system. If you leave this course with nothing other than an understanding of the hacker mentality, I have been successful by some measure. However, my goal is to help guide you through the first few steps of your journey into this world and to help you find your path afterwards as you develop even more advanced skills and continue your constant growth.

While I have tried to do everything in my ability to make this course self-guided, there are hundreds of places where a questioning attitude will identify clear shortfalls in the content. Some of these are intentional, most of them are not. Your questions and feedback will guide the development of this course so that it can become the best resource possible.

Surrounding this site is a community to help you and provide guidance as you move along.  This community grows with each student who signs up, and our mentors will be there every step of the way to answer questions, explain difficult concepts, and talk about just about anything to help you along the way. Make sure to take full advantage of the many ways we provide to message other mentors so that we can all be part of this together.

!! Enrollment Instructions !!


This already was in the first section of the course, but the UI is not intuitive so a lot of people are having trouble enrolling themselves. Follow this to get yourself registered for the course.

Yes... Enrolment is spelled wrong. I have been informed by our distinguished British brethren that this the way they spell the word. This is an open source web app and I guess the developers are Brits. As an organization uniquely proud of America, it pains me not to create a fork specifically to fix it. Maybe someday I will, but for now... it is spelled enrol here.

First off, while you can view the course as a guest, you do need to register for the site in order to enroll. If you're not registered yet, click <https://navy.hoppersroppers.org/login/signup.php?> to signup.

Enrollment in the course after site registration is not automatic! Unfortunately, it is not particularly intuitive, so I made this walkthrough.

1. Using this image, click on the top right gear shaped button.

Hopper's ...


# Hopper's
Our team has gone by many names, but one of our favorite's is Hopper's Roppers. I know you know who she is.

To learn more about her, read this: [http://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809](http://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809)

Have you ever heard the quote, �It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.�? That was her.

![alt text](https://i2.wp.com/hopperboulder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Grace1-2.jpg?w=704&ssl=1 "img1")

This quote comes from an interview in the July 1986 CHIP�s Ahoy Magazine, the Department of the Navy�s Information Technology Magazine. She was at the cutting edge then and it is a testament to her vision how well this interview stands up to the test of time. Her passion for knowledge and innovation is the most important thing you can carry with you.

... ROPpers


# Roppers

While there was a chance you knew what Hopper's meant, it is very unlikely that you have had any idea what Roppers meant, mostly because it is a word we made up to define a group of people who ROP. And if you have never heard of ROP, or Return Oriented Programming before, and.... that is not just okay, that is expected, because why on earth would you have known about an obscure programming topic before this exact moment in time. To quote Wikipedia, "Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as non-executable memory (W xor X technique) and code signing by chaining together carefully chosen machine instruction sequences to get control of the stack..."

Don't worry; none of that should have meant anything to you. That would have made zero sense to me when I was sitting where you are sitting. 2 years into my journey, I would have understood about half of it. Today, I still have no idea what a W or X technique is because I copied that definition from Wikipedia.

While many other sites that attempt to teach this material assume you already know a great deal of knowledge, we take a different approach to make this challenging subject as approachable as possible. For all of the great resources out there, and all of the incredible pieces of training, nothing walks a complete beginner all the way through the process of developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals. Everyone wants to learn how to do stuff, but very quickly they realize that there is no way for them to learn everything. They�re not wrong, the vast and constantly expanding body of knowledge about this field makes it impossible for anyone to keep up. But what is most important for the beginner to realize is that with the proper knowledge of the fundamentals and a firm grasp on the hacker mentality, that irrepressible drive to learn and to do, nothing is too complex for them to learn if they put the time in. By managing new your high expectations of yourself, providing constant feedback on your progress, and bringing you into the community, this is designed to minimize dropout rate while providing the best first hundred hours of a cyber security education possible.

Core Tenets


## Core Tenets

![alt text](https://news.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/horizontal_image/public/d6_files/YaleNews_hopper-grace.UNIVAC.102635875-CC_0.jpg?itok=4HL3ETlO "img3")

This site is designed around a series of ideas that we think will make your experience as a learner as good as possible.

1. No initial expectation of knowledge
2. Everyone moves at their own pace
3. Understanding foundational theory comes before building technical skills
4. Developing fundamental technical skills lays the groundwork for success in any topic
5. Knowledge must be actionable
6. The measure of a community is how they treat those who are trying to gain entry
7. There is no such thing as being done learning

Anytime something on this site doesn't seem to be matching up with our core tenets, let us know so I can fix it. We made as many possible mechanisms for you to help us improve our approach, the content, and the community of this site as possible. This site is a living entity and will change on a regular basis so that we can improve your experience.

# So What is ROP?
All you need to know right now is that ROP is an advanced exploitation technique which beats advanced defenses by chaining together code which was already in a program. That definition is good enough for now, but if you stick around with us, soon enough you will know what it means and eventually you will be writing ROP chains of your own. The critical bit to understand is that you take snippets of existing code, chain it back together in a new order, and then use those to jump to where you need to go next. As you go through this course you will do the same thing, rearranging already learned information and skills to jump to new locations.

Nothing in this course is spoonfed, and while we try to give you good resources, there are multiple parts in the course where we tell you to swing by yourself and go find out how to do something. We do this when we know there are plenty of other high quality resources out there for you to learn from and we want you to become comfortable being given no direction other than a couple searchterms and having to rely on your own knowledge and problem solving skills.

## Content
This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of the Boat School's Cyber Security Team and various guides scattered throughout the internet on how to break into information security. We put this curriculum together by aggregating all of the guides and tutorials we could find, took what we thought was important and added our own commentary. To say that this is built on the backs of a hundred other people's work would be an understatement, and we am forever grateful that we are part of a community which has created so many amazing resources. All attempts to cite source material have been made, if there is anything we have not properly attributed, let us know. Despite having been in the works for the last four years, this is the first iteration of the curriculum and it should change drastically as we see what does and doesn't work, and the only way we will know is feedback.

Hacking


The etymology of the word �hack� is very complicated, and anywhere you go you will find some slight disagreements. This is the most concise article you can find on the subject. <http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack>. As stated in the article, this is a point of contention, but honestly, it doesn't matter. If someone cares deeply about the definition of hack or hacker, good for them, but it shouldn't effect you.

However, the most commonly agreed upon source for definitions is this page, <http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html>, mostly because it has been around for a while and has the loosest definitions.

Legal Stuff


## Legal Stuff
Unsurprisingly, in this course you will learn some things that could be used to do bad things. You might not think they're bad things at the time, and they might seem like funny pranks, or even more dangerous, seem like you are doing the right thing at the time, but the laws against hacking are very vague and intent does not matter. Even more importantly, you probably have a security clearance, and having a pile of felonies you have to admit to is not a great look and will complicate your paperwork.

In the US, the law that surrounds this stuff is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Basically, all you need to know is that every computer is a protected computer and that it is a crime to intentionally access a computer or account without authorization or to exceed authorized access.

Exceed authorized access is a real sticky subject, and it has led to a bunch of prosecutions.

To stay on the safe side, only access computers you own, or have written consent to access. At some point we will build an entire network of training computers you can do whatever you want on. For now, there are plenty of sites that let you learn on their networks. The people who learn by seeing what is open on the internet are the ones who get into trouble.

## Copyright

It should also be mentioned that copyright law is also a good way to get in trouble, not to mention that if you see software to pirate on the internet, it is very unlikely that it doesn't contain malware. Just don't steal things, we can almost always get a copy of whatever you want, it just might take some paperwork and some emails.

## Classification
Absolutely nothing here is classified, in any way, whatsoever. Nothing is derived from classified information. Don't bring any of that to this site. Thanks!

Code of Conduct


### 0. Regulations and the UCMJ Always Apply

### 1. Purpose
A primary goal of Hopper's Roppers is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in this organization to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### 2. Open Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. If you see someone who is acting to the detriment of our community, we want to know.

### 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
Posting or threatening to post other people�s personally identifying information ("doxing").
Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
Inappropriate photography or recording.
Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone�s consent before touching them.
Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
Stealing any equipment.
Unauthorized access, even as a prank, to anyone's systems or accounts.

### 5. Weapons Policy
Weapons are encouraged. However if you use a weapon to threaten anyone, expect to wake up in a hospital.

### 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and especially those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

### 7. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, notify a community organizer as soon as possible. All members of the community are expected to report any unacceptable behavior and if reporting will not stop the behavior in time to avoid a negative outcome, take immediate action.

Reports can be sent via any of the instant messaging platforms such as Slack, or to my email at d.m.devey@gmail.com.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Please let us know so we can help you.

### 8. Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the staff with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

We will work with all parties to ensure the Code of Conduct is enforced. All decisions made by the staff is final.

### 9. Scope
We expect all community participants (organizers, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues�online and in-person�as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

Join Us


## Slack
Instant group messaging has been a cultural staple of the internet community since its inception, as it is truly one of the most important functions that global interconnectedness can serve. In the beginning there was email, then bulletin boards systems (BBS), then Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Finally, there was Slack.

Slack has become the messaging platform of choice, allowing group collaboration and real time chat along with various plug-ins and file hosting integration. We use it for many of feedback, support, as a forum, and as our primary instant messaging channel. At some point we might migrate to a self-hosted server, but for now, Slack is the easiest to work with.

Join our channel at <https://launchpass.com/hoppersroppers> and post a hello!

If this is not working for you, it is because you have an ad-blocker installed. If you do, whitelist the site or open it in Incognito mode and enter your email. We'll learn all about ad-blockers and why that broke the site for you later. If you continue having problems, message us here or email us.

Choose a nickname, or what we call online, a "handle" for yourself. Don't worry about it too much, you will come up with something good eventually, and you are not stuck with whatever you start with. As a general rule, don't call yourself something like "Dark Shadow". Unless you want to. In that case, do that. I probably had a dozen or so before settling on my current one, 'deevnull'. I liked mine because it is a nerd joke (that will be explained about halfway through this course) and incorporates my last name.  Send me a message with a brief introduction to let me know you joined. We use Slack for just about everything from helping on problems, submitting feedback, or just talking about random things.

## Twitter
Unsurprisingly, information security Twitter is a very exciting place. In the modern age, where information flows at the speed of light, Twitter is the place to be if you want to stay informed and on the cutting edge. It is an overwhelming amount of information, so you want to start off following only a few accounts. It is going to be a lot for you right now to actually try to read and understand the firehose, so we will start you slow and with a small number of beginner-friendly follows that really only post news. If you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it.

### Optional:
Create a "professional" twitter account! Remember, this twitter will be able to be associated with you, even if you want to stay pseudo-anonymous. Always keep it fun and professional. Now subscribe to this list, or just follow the people on it: <https://twitter.com/deevnull/lists/cst>. This list has been curated to only include must follows with a range of jobs that will provide insight into what is happening around the field.

Follow @HoppersRoppers on Twitter so we can follow you. Again, if you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it. It is mostly just a giant waste of time, but it is interesting and you learn a ton.


### OPSEC
You don't need a speech on OPSEC. Follow Rob Joyce. <https://twitter.com/RGB_Lights>

## Github
A major part of hacker culture is the idea of open source technology. What is open source? We will go into it later, but basically it is distributing software for free so that people can use and make changes in order to build the best software possible. GitHub is the modern center of the open source community, providing free hosting for millions of projects. In fact, almost the entire content of this site is on Github! A great deal of hacker street cred is based around the things you create and release to the public, and the best way to do that is on GitHub. In this course, we use Github to learn good development practices so that you can be a more effective coder.

The 'Competitive' Team


When you sign up for this site, you automatically become a member of our not-at-all competitive team, which also happens to be named Hopper's Roppers. This whole site is grown out of the training I made for my college security team who competed in various cyber security competitions. Now, Hopper's Roppers is a distributed team, open to anyone, but is especially meant to be a place for beginners to learn the ropes in and we will participate in any event we have the numbers for. You will not be ready to compete while you are still working your way through this course... the good news, is you don't need to be ready to compete to do it. All you have to do is sign up, know your brain is going to hurt and you probably won't understand anything, and be ready to learn.

There is no better measure of ability, grit, and the hacker mentality than playing in a competition. Every CTF requires you to use what you already know to identify what you will need to learn on the spot to solve the problem. As you are now a member of our team, we will let you know when competitions are occurring and we hope to see you there if you have the time. Even if you are new and don't think you have anything to contribute, you will learn more picking someone's brain as you shoulder-surf them (or watch them on Twitch) than you possibly could trying to learn by yourself.

Join the Team


Request to join the Hopper's Roppers team on CTFtime.

<https://ctftime.org/team/104886>

CTFtime is great because it lets you find upcoming events <https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming> as well as provides a leaderboard for the best teams around the world. We are pretty low on the leaderboard for now, but the more people we have playing the better we will be.

What You Will Learn


There are a wide variety of skills required to succeed in a CTF competition.

This course will attempt to teach you everything you need to know to start and take on any competition.

First, we will start with how to use Linux and linux command line tools. Then after a brief introduction to python scripting, we will launch into CTF specific topics.

Forensics is comprised of host-based and network forensics and we will go into the basics of that. Cryptography will be brief and will go over basic problems and how to solve them. We will also go into the basics of web exploitation and how some of those challenges work.

This is a beginner course, so we will not be getting into Reverse Engineering or Binary Exploitation at all. This is meant to prepare you for the picoCTF competition where you will have to figure out how to use the skills and resources you learned in this course to solve problems as you go.

This Shit is Hard


Doing cool things with computers is hard (have I said that before), and yes there is an aspect that requires technical knowledge, but mostly, it just takes time. Doing cool things with computers is less of a technical challenge and more of an attitude and a willingness to work hard and teach yourself what you need to know in order to succeed in whatever you are trying to do. Our curriculum here is meant to give you the basic tools you will need to understand the challenges you face, but solving them is going to be on you. We'll be honest, this isn't easy. This isn't something that will take you a month or two to get the hang of. One of the primary curses of doing cool shit with computers is that each time you learn something, you immediately realize a new pile of things that you do not know. There's nothing wrong with not knowing things, and no one could ever expect you to. Even "experts" will only know a small slice of the greater field that is doing cool things with computers. Expecting anyone to be good at everything is ridiculous, but it is even more ridiculous for anyone to think a beginner should know everything... or really, anything. There's a lot of acronyms, slang, in-jokes, and domain specific knowledge. One of the promises we will make to you is that we will not ever put in an acronym, slang, or in-joke without explaining it.

If you can stick with and complete this course, you will be armed with the baseline knowledge and attitude you need to be able to learn anything. Probably the most important skill you will learn is how to use all of your resources effectively, whether that is your classmates, teachers, reference pages, or Google. Mostly, Google. It will take a year or two before you get comfortable and stop feeling totally lost every day, but then you'll just start working on harder problems and you'll wind up more confused than you could imagine being now. Being good at computering is a long term process of reinforcing and building on the basic knowledge we will teach you in this course, and it will never end until you decide the computers have won. Don't let the computers win, and keep learning everything you can.

Hacker Attitude


Read this post: [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) It isn't perfect, but it will do for now until I write a new one.�The biggest problem with this is that the author, while once a famous hacker and important member of the open source movement, is a total asshole. None of the content is bad, but we are in the process of trying to write something to replace all of his content in this curriculum.

While there is a lot in there that is very interesting, the most important part is the hacker attitude.

[1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1)

[2.No problem should ever have to be solved twice.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe2)

[3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe3)

[4. Freedom is good.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe4)

[5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe5)

These 5 statements provide a reasonable framework for how you should approach learning this material. It should be fun, we shouldn't be wasting your time, there should be multiple ways for you to succeed, and we are measuring success by your ability at the end. Make sure you've really read through the post and then write 4-6 sentences on your interpretation of the last sentence in part one of the Hacker Attitude, �You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity � a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece � and so on, until you're done.�

Hacker Ethic


From the same site as the Hacker How-To comes this brief description of the hacker ethic. Again, I am in the process of writing something else, but for now this is good enough.�

Read it: [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html)

It breaks the hacker ethic into two main beliefs that complement one another:�


1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.

2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

A longer version of the hacker ethic comes from the famous book _Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution_ that you probably should read someday, but there is no rush. I haven't read the whole thing yet. �

The Wikipedia article is pretty good so read it:�[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic)

They come out to 5 key beliefs:

1. Access to computers�and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works�should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
2. All information should be free (Often a topic of debate, he means free as in speech, rather than free as in beer)�
3. �Mistrust authority�promote decentralization
4. �Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer. The concept of "hack value" is doing something that is worth doing because of the "playful cleverness" required.�
6. �Computers can change your life for the better

Write a few sentences on what matters in the hacker ethic.

Sharing


One of the key parts of this mindset is sharing knowledge with others. A great quote on the subject is 'There is�nothing noble�in�being superior�to your fellow man; true nobility is�being superior�to your former self.' �Not to mention, the more you give back to the community, the greater the value you provide. If you're just starting off, you might not think you have anything to provide, but in fact, you're looking at the world with a different perspective than someone who has done it for years. For example, you can provide feedback on when training makes no sense or isn't as effective as it could be, and help make it easier for the next person to go through it. This site is a work in progress and the more feedback we receive the better it will be. �

With that said, you're definitely going to have questions. There are nearly infinite resources out there, and it is rare that you wind up doing something no one has ever done before. If you think you are there, message someone or make a post in the forum so we can all look for resources, and congratulations. Before that you have google and people here to help you, and we will always try to help in any way that we can. One of the worst things about hacker culture is this idea that someone should �Read the Fucking Manual� or �RTFM�. The first recorded use of this was in a user manual for some program in 1979, so it goes way back. On first glance, RTFM is a great response for any question that should have been answered by a casual glance at the manual. The problem with this idea is that a large body of knowledge is usually required to understand the manual, and even before that, you need to know the manual exists. If you are taking this course, there is no possible way you can be expected to understand a manual because you are just getting started. The most common "manual" you will come across in this course and your travels through hackerdom are the man-pages that accompany every single aspect of the Unix operating system, and they are a great resource for people who have spent years learning how to understand them. Right now, you don�t have the knowledge to be expected to understand how they work, and that is fine. There is no pressure to know anything, but there is pressure to learn.�

RTFM


### In Defense of RTFM

RTFM gets a bad rap for good reason, because it is usually used as a put down on someone who doesn't know much about a subject... with that said, once you have the knowledge to understand a topic, if you are using that software, you should read the manual. Even if you don't understand the manual, if you are going to ask a question, you might as well reference that you know the manual exists and that what you are asking is referenced, you just need clarification. If you ask questions effectively you will find you understand your initial question and the topic much better than if you had someone explain the answer to just your specific question.

## Google

The same goes for "Search engines are your friend" or "Let Me Google That For You" if an answer can be solved with a verbatim search of the question asked. There are very very few questions you are going to ask that Google can't answer. But sometimes your questions might be a little too vague to make sense, or you don't really know what you are trying to find out. Luckily, you have people here who can help you. One of the best questions you can ask people for is for search terms on a subject. That way they don't have to spend time explaining it, and you get all the benefits of doing the research yourself. You might already know some cool google tricks to get better results, but don't worry... we will teach you all of them until you are wise in the ways of Google Fu.

You will use google for 98% of all CTF questions. That's just how it goes. CTFs are for learning new things, very rarely is it for doing something you already know off the top of your head.

For now, check out this site with [Google tricks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/) and submit a screenshot of the search results for Hopper's Roppers using the operator symbol that only returns results that include all terms within quotes in the exact given order.

Questions


## Questions

This section is derived from "How to Ask Smart Questions" by the ESR CATB guy we've already looked at a few times in this section. As we already said, guy is a total asshole so I am not going to send any more traffic his way.

* Choose your forum carefully
* Use meaningful, specific subject headers
* Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language
* Be precise and informative about your problem
* Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

1. Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: �Fedora Core 7�, �Slackware 9.1�, etc.).
2. Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
3. Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.
4. Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.
5. If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.

* Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order
* Describe the goal, not the step
* Be explicit about your question
* Follow up with a brief note on the solution

You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. Just show you tried ahead of time and no one will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough.�

If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than Googling and you'll get more out of it.�

We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it.�

Visit this [man-page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write down the first three things you don�t understand.�Then google them and figure out what they are. Submit 3 sentences explaining the 3 things you didn�t know.�For the love of everything, don�t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, �Boredom and Drudgery are evil.� If you're not getting anything out of something at any point in this course, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time. We mean that. You won't hurt our feelings.

Brainwashing and Learning


## Brainwashing

As we said before, hacking is a mindset, not a skillset. Sure you'll pick up plenty of useful skills along the way, but the primary benefit of the hacker mentality is being able to look at the world, see a problem you've never approached before, and figure out how to solve it. We are trying to cultivate that mindset, and yes, we are going to try to subtly brainwash you. We're not sorry about it. Genuine interest and drive are the two best indicators of success in this field, and we want to encourage it as much as we possibly can. How do we teach that? How do we measure that? We don't know. If we were pretentious losers we might say we're trying to hack your brain into becoming a hacker. But we're not. So lets call it brainwashing. Are you okay with being brainwashed?*





* Note: This probably is not legally binding.


## Continuous Learning

Learning this stuff isn't easy. The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up seemingly impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that. This course is intended to give you a general base of knowledge so that you can succeed with anything you do, but if you want to be great you have to love what you're doing and keep getting after it. For the rest of your time computering, maintain a series of lists. I recommend a Google Sheets file with a bunch of tabs. These are just a few we recommend, I'm sure you'll make more.

* Questions you don't know the search terms for
* Questions that google can't answer
* Things you want to learn how to do
* Things you want to learn more about
* Things you want to make or help make
* Things you want to tell other people about or write about
* Potential future reading material
* Links to things you want to remember

We will do our absolute best to help you keep these lists short. There will be section in the Slack for random questions, from ELI5 style to "Make me a tutorial", or you can always just private message it.

# S.M.A.R.T Goals
SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. One of the hardest things about learning cyber security is setting the bar for what you want to achieve and figuring out the path to get there. This course exists to give new learners the ability to know exactly what they need to do to get to the skills described in the course description page, specifically:

"You will know the terminology and mental models, the theory and some of the science, and the basics of every topic listed below. In addition you will be comfortable with learning new systems, tools, and concepts, be a competent Python programmer, and a skilled operator of the Windows and Linux operating systems. We won't turn you into a hacker, but we will give you the tools to do it yourself."

Now, using this course as your guide, set a goal using the SMART method:

*Complete this course, as defined as finishing all the content, before (_a_date_you_define)*

With most of the goal already defined for you, what you need to focus on is the timeline you want to set for yourself.

Answer these questions:

1. How much time a week do you want to spend working on this?
2. How much time a week do you think you will actually have to work on this?
3. How many weeks do you think you will not have any time to work?

Submit the your questions and your goal date for this course.

Virtualization


# Building Your Own Lab
## Introduction
Building your own lab is important for a lot of reasons, but most importantly it is fun and teaches you a bunch of valuable information. In this section we will do some work securing our daily lives and install a virtual machine for us to work on. What you will be making is uniquely yours and will be something that you will work on and refine for the rest of your time doing the computers. This is your new workbench/hangout spot, so take pride in what you are making and make it yours.

## Virtualization
Why do we use virtualization?

Read [https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization)

Write up a few sentences on the primary benefits of running a virtualized environment inside of your Windows machine.

Install VMWare


Install free virtualization software to run your virtual machine in!

I recommend WMWare player, as that has been what I have always used, however there are many alternatives, primarily VirtualBox and QEMU.

**NOTE: If you already have virtualization software installed, use them if you don't want to download an extra program to your computer. It will slightly change your experience, but everything that happens inside the VM will remain the same so it will not hurt your ability to learn.**

[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

This should be very straightforward. When you are complete, submit a screenshot of VMWare (or whatever you decided to use). Use the Microsoft 'Snip' tool to forever change your screenshot game. Just type "Snip" into the search bar and it will appear.

Install Linux


Now that you have virtualization software, you need an operating system to run inside of it. You can run a Windows machine, an Apple machine, really whatever. For now we are only going to install a Linux operating system, chosen for its ease of use. In this course we recommend Ubuntu, and while there are many people on the internet with strong opinions on this, I am not changing my recommendation. If you already have a VM with a Linux image on it, you don't need to download a new one just for this course. It will not change any aspect of your experience and there is no need to waste time or space.

An image is what we refer to an Operating System when packaged into a format that can be run off of a disc, usually having a .iso extension. We can download .iso's and boot off of the disc, but it's generally easier to use a VM.

[https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

I could give you more information on what to do for this, but there are a ton of tutorials and youtube videos out there. Should be an easy google, and the information doesn't change too much. Let us know if you have any problems, but I recommend going step by step through a tutorial. This is your first challenge that we are telling you to figure it out yourself.

We always try to link to the source of things, even dank memes. It's a weird thing to care about, but the internet makes it so easy to repost images without any way of crediting the author, and they're producing content so might as well throw them a follow.

When you're done, submit a screenshot of you running your VM.

Install VMWare Tools


Your VM software might have automatically done this for you, or perhaps your guide had you did this. If not, you need to install VMWare Tools for Ubuntu.  If you are not using VMWare or Ubuntu, skip this or figure out its equivalent.

You need this for a lot of critical usability things, and it doesn't come pre-installed. You have most likely already seen prompts telling you to do this. Do it. I'll be honest, this can be kind of difficult sometimes, but you have to figure your own way through this. Again, if you have any trouble, and this takes more than a half hour to figure out, message us and we will help you out. There is no shame, I've had VMs before that I gave up trying to install VMWare tools and just sucked it up for the rest of the time I needed it. You'll be on this VM for a while, so you need to get it installed.

When complete, submit a screenshot that shows VMWaretools (or its equivalent) installed.

Over the Wire Bandit


Here it is: Over the Wire...

You might have heard of this before. It's the big one.

This is a classic set of challenges that every member of our team has fought through, and while it takes some time, you should have had enough experience to figure out what you need to do. It won't be easy, and it might not be the most fun, but completion of this challenge is the single greatest determining factor in whether or now you continue along this journey. This is where you have to grind it out, make things happen, get stuck, learn things, and really spend some quality time with man pages.

Let us know if you get stuck on any challenge for longer than a half hour, we will gladly point you in the right direction. And no cheating, as Hemingway once said, �There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.� We like Hemingway. He  was a big fan of boats and adventures. We are too.

While there are 25 Bandit levels, at this time we only expect you to be able to complete 1-13. They will be hard, but we know you can do them. The rest of the levels are saved for different places throughout the rest of the course.

Whenever you finish lessons, 1, 5, 10 let us know in chat! When you finish 13, let everyone know in Slack! If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us through whatever format you want and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage. If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search results.

Good luck!!!! We are not going to let you end your journey here!!!

Programming Languages


There are plenty of people out there who say you can be good at computers and cyber security without knowing how to program. Those people are wrong. Sorry for being a jerk about it.


If you can't program, you are going to spend a horrible amount of time clicking things and manually doing things that should be automated. Of course, there are exceptions for people with very specific skillsets, but for everyone else, a working knowledge of programming and the ability to script anything will carry you as far as you need to go. You will always be learning and forgetting basic parts of the languages you work with, but it becomes easier to get back into an old language or learn a new one every time. But before you can start writing your own malware and machine learning pipelines, it's time to learn the basics of programming, Git, HTML, and get proficient with Python.


## Programming Languages
This is important. Try to really understand the breadth of what programming languages are.

   * Introduction to Programming Languages
      * <https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Programming/About_Programming>
   * Hello World in a variety of Languages. Check out bash, python, c, assembly, and perl.  <https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text>
  * <https://norvig.com/21-days.html>

   2. In your own words describe what a programming language is.

Python


There are hundreds of languages out there, but the language we are going to start with is Python. Python is a fairly simple and easy to learn language, but more importantly, is fast to write and allows advanced you to throw together scripts whenever you need them. There are a ton of great security references and plugins to the language and it allows you to accomplish just about anything you could need to do using just one language. In the future you will learn plenty other languages, but for right now, Python will suffice.

This is going to take a while, but Codeacademy Python is the best way I've found to learn a first programming language. It is all done in an online editor and will let you progress with the appropriate hints.

**NOTE: If you already know a programming language and don't need to re-learn what a tuple is, or are already learning Python using a different site or course, let us know. We can customize your experience here, there is no hard rule you have to use Code Academy.**

Keep us updated in chat on your progress, we will be reaching out to you too. When you are done, submit a screenshot of your completion certificate!!

   * Complete Code Academy Python
      * <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python>

So you know a language now, right? Congratulations! The thing to remember is that all skills, if not used, will slowly atrophy. My recommendation is to constantly challenge yourself to maintain your skill level so when you have to write a program, you can whip something up immediately without having to relearn the syntax... or you can just ignore it completely and when the need arises, spend a half hour fumbling until you remember enough to get it working. Both of those are completely valid ways to maintain proficiency in a language. This course won't teach you any more languages, but if you continue in this pipeline you will learn C and some low level assembly.

Python from the Terminal


 You are a big bad programmer now, but it has all been done in your browser! Time to learn how to do it from the terminal on your computer(s). This might require some googling..... don't worry, that is literally how programming works. You find something you need to do, and google how to do it. Then you forget how to do it, and you go and google it again the next time you do it. The next bit will help you set up your python environment in your OS's. Setting up environments is very time consuming, no matter what it is, but you will have to do this for basically every language, and every version of each language, so you will have to get good at it.


# Windows

* <https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html>
1. What is a path? You might have to google around to understand it. Hint: If you mess this up, things get interesting.
2. Submit a screenshot of you running a .py file from the command line in Windows!

# Linux
* <https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/unix.html>
1. Submit a screenshot of you running a .py file from the command line in Linux!

* Know how to a run bash command from within a python script
   * ref: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26236126/how-to-run-bash-command-inside-python-script>
1. Submit a screenshot of you running a bash command from inside a python script.

Programming and scripting are different, but share most of the same principles, and these principles will be shared between all languages. Once you can program well in one language, you can learn any language, it just will take a bit to learn.

Canonical Documents (I/P)

## Flag Format

While the flag format seems like a small detail, annoying flag formats can turn an otherwise decent CTF challenge into a frustrating experience.

Wherever possible, make the flag a simple ASCII string that competitors discover while solving the problem, and NOT a complex format like

`<md5(name of target)>_<date of event>_<function address>`

These formats are easy to accidentally under-specify! How should the name be capitalized? Does the date use slashes, dashes, or dots as separators? Does the date include the time, and in what time zone? How precise does the time need to be, seconds, milliseconds or microseconds? Is the function address in hex? Is it zero-padded to 8 or 16 digits? Does it start with "0x", or not?

Furthermore, compound flag formats often make it hard for competitors to know when they've found the right thing; there are always several permutations to try each time someone has a new guess, and it's not rewarding to fiddle with formats while wondering how close you are.

(There may be some good problems that absolutely require complex formats. Proceed with caution, and watch out for ambiguity.)

Do not ask players to hash something they get and send the hash as the flag. As with the above, it is difficult to specify exactly what needs to go into the hash, and trivial errors in capitalization or newlines will give an incorrect result. Additionally, the hash itself will not be harder to guess than whatever the original flag was, so why not just submit that directly? As an organizer, it is also useful to watch submission logs to see what people are sending in as flags to get an idea of whether or not hints are needed or players are hitting unexpected roadblocks. If all you see are a slew of MD5 hashes, you won't have a clue what is going on.

A flag should always look obviously like a flag to submit. If the flag
is "Congratulations you win!" or "1234", some competitors may not
realize when they have solved the challenge and continue to spend time
on it. It's recommended that organizers pick a common format like
"MyCTF{663d63e8c755f1b4}" or "funny\_1337speaK\_pHras3" for ALL flags in a competition. (It also helps if you can include "The flag is:" in front of some flags).

Avoid brute forcible flags. For example, if flag has to be the name of a city, some players might try to submit thousands of guesses. Please do not put a CAPTCHA in front of all key submissions. This is unnecessary and extremely annoying to players.

Be maximally permissible with flag checking. The flag submission should be case-insensitive and reasonably flexible. A nice feature is to accept any of "CTF{663d63e8c755f1b4}", "663D63E8C755F1B4", "flag is: 663D63E8C755F1B4", etc. Another nice feature is to trim/strip white space characters in flag submissions as they can easily be added when copying and pasting into web forms.

## Mechanics

CTFs are games for fun, but are also largely security skill exercises. Gameplay mechanics surrounding the challenges can add fun and intrigue, but don't always exercise security skills.  The best CTF challenges are both fun and on-topic. Having teams strategize about game mechanics isn't bad, but the core of a CTF is always its security challenges.

Therefore, any CTF scoring system--however complex--must strongly tend to reward the teams that demonstrate the best security skills. Think hard on your game mechanics, and try to keep them from being exploitable or distracting too much from the core challenges. (Not that that can't be fun, but little in this document would apply to such a competition!)

Some common mechanics for Jeopardy-style CTFs:

1. Make the more difficult "tour-de-force" problems worth more points, and the easier or higher-variance trivia and guessing problems worth fewer points. This encourages people to look at the difficult problems and learn hardcore security skillz! Don't worry about fine-tuning point values: there is no "perfect". Keep in mind that people who test a problem typically know its difficulty better than the problem author, so testers usually assign the most suitable point-values.
2. Employ "breakthru points": extra points (usually only good for tie-breaking) given to the first three-or-so teams to solve each particular challenge. This discourages "flag hoarding", where a team holds on to their flags and only submits them all at the very end of the competition (which is often advantageous for that team). It's demoralizing to find out that you are not doing as well as you thought, so it is useful to have anti-hoarding measures like breakthru points.
3. The open/closed status of a problem should be global, meaning that if a problem is open for one team, it should be open for all teams. This gives all teams a fair time and chance to look at all of the problems, and avoids situations where a team gets screwed by opening unlucky challenges.
4. Ensure that all teams on the scoreboard always have at least 2-3 problems open to work on. It's all too easy for any team to get stuck on some particular challenge (possibly through no fault of their own!), and making sure that all players have something that they'd like to work on in their hands is the best way to keep everyone happy.
5. Limit the number of unsolved challenges opened. This helps to avoid giving large teams a huge advantage. And hey, you just might be able to save some unopened challenges for next year ;)

## Testing

Testing is the difference between a horrible problem and a great one. Have a reference solution you can run to verify services are working and solvable whenever someone asks. Have someone other than the original problem author write the solution to make sure it's doable without having to be a psychic. If you don't have time to test everything, focus on the "black box" problems first.

## Communication

Organizers should strive to be reachable throughout the entire CTF. Have an IRC channel and monitor it throughout the CTF. Give organizers operator status on the channel so that players know who they can discuss problem details with.

Publish and monitor an email address.

Have at least one other communication channel like a Twitter stream or a news page on the site to ensure that nobody misses any important game updates.

## Problem Updates

Whenever a change is made to a problem, announce it in a permanent and visible place, in addition to in IRC. Make sure to update the problem description to reflect the change. For any downloadable problem files which have changed, update the file name so that it is obvious it has changed.

When applicable, leave the original version of the problem available and running. For example, someone might be really close on that pwnable you want to update and make easier :)

If a problem has already been solved, be extremely sensitive about making changes to problems (this includes changing the point value, problem files, description, hints, etc.). These issues usually need to be handled case-by-case, so please exercise good judgment!

CTF Meta (I/P)


Host forensics is the most hated of all CTF problem types. This is not because the problems are particularly hard or boring, but is because some people who make the problems are lazy and make it into a dumb guessing game. Personally, forensics problems are my favorite category. It's the one that has the most applicability to real world jobs, is super easy to get started, and when the problems are done correctly, it is basically like solving a mystery.

There are a few categories of forensic problems that we will go over in this course, focusing on the ones that we see in CTF problems the most frequently. None of this should be confused with what actual forensic analysts do in an incident response, however, many of the skills overlap and there are some fundamental theories that can be applied to CTF problems.

Representing Data 1


* How do these ones and zeros work? <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary>
* Also hey, what is hex? <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal>

   1. You should have a hex editor in your VM.
   2. Download our logo and view it in the Hex Editor.
   3. What is a magic number? What is the magic number of our logo?

File formats (and networking protocols, and all sorts of other things on the internet) are defined in documents known as RFCS. Read through the .png format RFC and find where the magic number is defined. Nobody has this content memorized, but when they deep dive into a format or protocol, the RFC has the answers. <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083>

Any time you need to deal with a file format, google will provide most of the answers. If you need to dig deeper than that, go to the RFC.

* Also, hey, what is ascii? This is ascii. <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ascii>

   1. Do this <https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/number-systems-an-introduction-to-binary-hexadecimal-and-more--active-10848. Submit a screenshot showing your completion.>


   0. How many bits are used for each character in ASCII?
   1. "01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001" is in binary. Convert it back to ASCII. Do it by hand using the chart.
   2. Alright. Now. Convert 17 in Ascii to Binary and Hex. Do it by hand.
   3. Convert "Go Navy" to Octal, Hex, and Binary. Yes. By hand. Use Google to figure out how.
   4. What does "c2l4dHlmb3Vy" translate to from Base64?

* It is annoying to do that by hand, but it does help. Here is a tool so that you never have to do that again. <https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/>. Fun fact, it is released by GCHQ, Britain's version of the NSA. Great tool and very useful. There are about a thousand uses for this thing, you can find a bunch on GitHub.

3. While you are learning about polyglot files, you should learn about POC || GTFO. <https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/bibles-you-should-read-poc-gtfo/>. They are very entertaining, though highly advanced. Download <https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo07.pdf> and go read Chapter 6. It will open your mind to what is possible, and like all good pieces of education, will mostly serve to teach you how little you know.

Steganography 1


Steganography, or stego, challenges are among the most hated of all CTF challenges because they really are only limited in difficulty by how much of a pain in the ass the people who wrote the challenge are. No matter the challenge, if you've come across a picture that doesn't have anything useful in it or in the metadata and have spent far too long trying to figure out what it means, it is worthwhile to throw it into a few stego solvers you will download below. If it works, curse the person who made the challenge and continue working. If it doesn't work, you've exhausted one avenue and it's time to keep looking for something else.


Read this: <https://ctf101.org/forensics/what-is-stegonagraphy/>

Luckily, there are a few "standard" problems and tools that make solving those problems easier.

Complete this writeup and submit a screenshot of the answer: <https://github.com/krx/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/CSAW%2016%20Quals/for250%20-%20Watchword/jk_actual_writeup.md>

I recommend you use this link to download Stegsolve <https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve>.


I recommend you use this link to download Steghide <https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve>. Steghide is the defacto tool for password protected stego challenges, but don't forget to try steghide with no password.

With these two tools you should be able to solve 90% of all stego problems. Even if these don't work, they can still identify weirdness and you can investigate further.

CTF Meta (I/P)


Forensics can include a number of elements mixed together such as:

* Network (pcap files)
* Recon (identifying random things, people, locations)
* Anti-forensic techniques
Most forensic challenges can be tied in with Incident Response and teach the learner to handle things with care - this means running files or being careless could lead to loss of (challenge) data or information essential to solve the challenge. For example, write-blockers are utilized by forensic experts as a way of ensuring the integrity of the data is kept true and valid if used in court. A good challenge ensures the challenge leads players on a journey, an investigation of sorts with multiple sources of data leading to the culmination of ultimately one solution.

When looking through a network challenges, there are a few basic types of challenges you can expect to see.

1. A file is transferred
2. A conversation occurs between two addresses
3. A hidden channel is used to send information
4. Something occurred and you must follow a series of events to get to the final answer

These challenges often involve adding another level of work beyond the initial discovery of the communication, whether adding stego, encoding, encryption or a custom network protocol.

The most important thing to do in these challenges is to identify the attacked host, the attacking host, and then find the channel in between.

Wireshark (Requires Fixing)

* What is a packet capture?

A packet capture is the recording of all information that goes across your network. Preferably before you take this course you have some sort of networking experience, but what you really need to know is that it is possible to record all information that crosses a specific point in the path and then play it back so that an investigator can see everything that happened. If you don't have any networking experience, you can get away with learning as you go for the basics, but eventually you might want to become an expert so that you can crush these problems. Packet captures usually have the file extension .pcap or .pcapng, and are primarily opened with a tool named Wireshark.

* Work through the NewBoston Wireshark tutorial. No need to watch all of it, or at regular speed. Try 1.5 speed (or 2x) and bounce around to learn as much as you can.

<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBI2ZFuyZOl5Q7sptR7PwYN>

Wireshark is an amazing tool, install it in both your native Windows and your VM.

tShark

tShark is a command line tool to do the same things that Wireshark does. It is pretty awesome and allows you to script complex activities that you could never do in Wireshark. tShark should be your go to tool to solve these sort of problems.

Follow this tutorial: <https://hackertarget.com/tshark-tutorial-and-filter-examples/>

To create your initial pcap, run the command "tshark -i wlan0 -w capture-output.pcap" and then visit <https://hoppersroppers.org> and <http://zombo.com/>.

Then continue through the rest of the tutorial using the pcap you recorded.

Networking RFCs 1


RFCs or Request for Comments, is the way that the internet develops standards. Read this to learn more: <https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-request-for-comments-rfc-4092366> We talked about them a bit in the Representing Data section.

Now the important thing is how to read an RFC.

* From the organization that approves RFCs. <https://www.ietf.org/blog/how-read-rfc/>
* This is short and sweet but applies to just about any technical document: <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179022/how-does-one-read-rfcs-and-similar-documents>
* Skim the HTTP RFC to answer a few questions: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt>

1. Is this an official RFC? What RFC did it update?
2. What does this RFC give guidance on how to do?
3. What are the 5 families of response status codes?
4. What is a GET request and what does it look like?
5. What is a User-Agent?
6. What RFC guides "cache-control" in a header?

Networking RFCs 2


* Skim the DNS RFC to answer questions. I won't give you the RFC for this, go find it.

1. What is the format of a DNS Resource Request (RR) datagram?
2. What does RDATA do?
3. How many bytes (not octets) can be placed in an experimental NULL RDATA format?
4. How many bytes are messages carried by UDP restricted to?
5. What is the TC bit?
6. Would you describe the TC bit as... boolean? What is a bool?
7. In the header of a message, how many bits from the ID field is the TC bit?

Congratulations, you are, at this exact moment in time, the world's 2nd most knowledgeable person about TC bits. Alright, now time to forget that and move on to learning more important things, like reading the "Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers" for fun. I promise this one is shorter. <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt>

CTF Meta (I/P)


Cryptography is often considered to be one of the harder challenge types because many of the problems require deep specialization to understand. However, we are not teaching deep specialization in this course, we are teaching quick and dirty techniques to solve problems and find resources.

There are a variety of common crypto problems such as:

1. Ciphertext only
2. Ciphertext + private key and algorithm
3. Ciphertext and custom source code
4. Ciphertext + public key and algorithm

For the most part, you will always get enough ciphertext for meaningful statistics and for any advanced cryptography problem they will let you know what the algorithm is because the ciphertext will all be totally random. The only time you will get ciphertext only is for very short, classical algorithms.

It is also unlikely that any problem is going to require extensive password cracking or bruteforcing. If you find yourself needing extreme computation, expect to have made a wrong turn somewhere.

Frequency Analysis


Read this: <https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis>

Use the tool to determine the frequency of characters, bigrams, and trigrams of the text:

"Frequency analysis is the study of the distribution of the letters in a text. Analysis of frequencies help decrypting substitution-based ciphers using the fact that some letters apparitions are varying in a given language : in english, letters E, T or A are common while Z or Q are rare."

Then use the tool to determine frequency of chars, bigrams, and trigrams of this text:

"Iuhtxhqfb dqdobvlv lv wkh vwxgb ri wkh glvwulexwlrq ri wkh ohwwhuv lq d whaw. Dqdobvlv ri iuhtxhqflhv khos ghfubswlqj vxevwlwxwlrq-edvhg flskhuv xvlqj wkh idfw wkdw vrph ohwwhuv dssdulwlrqv duh ydublqj lq d jlyhq odqjxdjh : lq hqjolvk, ohwwhuv H, W ru D duh frpprq zkloh C ru T duh uduh."

Automated Frequency Analysis


Read this: <https://planetcalc.com/8047/>

Then decrypt this: "Iuhtxhqfb dqdobvlv lv wkh vwxgb ri wkh glvwulexwlrq ri wkh ohwwhuv lq d whaw.

Most automated cryptography tools use this sort of technique behind the scenes.

Another example is the chi-squared statistic: <http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/chi-squared-statistic/>

Crypto has a lot of math, but luckily, because it is math, someone else has usually written a tool to do it for you. It takes a lot of work to get to the cutting edge in this field.

4. "24hr5gBwyv4hrefnif34gApjDfRmei2iPD7V"
   * This text was encrypted with an alphabet of a-z,0-9 and has the string "1337" in the file
5. Why is that last ciphertext so much harder for an automated solver?

Most flags in competitions for all challenges, not just crypto will be obfuscated in the same way to prevent someone from bruteforcing.

6. "ms5yr 32e ud0s 5rdw1yq dg2e6 gnqdvrsobb dy7upnx, u81g k2b brz!"

"Fun" Ciphers


The good (and bad) thing about ciphers is that really anything can be used to convey information. This means you will come across all sorts of wild challenges. When you come across them, pay attention to hints and use google to try to identify what they are and where to find an online solver. If you can't find a solver you'll have to do it manually, or write your own.

Especially in a competition, doing it manually is faster than writing your own.

Modern Crypto


Cryptography has come a long way since the time of Caesar. Now, just about everything we do relies on math. Math, it turns out, is very hard to beat if it is done properly. Math can tell you that it is provably impossible for an attacker to decrypt something earlier than the heat death of the sun. That is pretty awesome. If you find yourself trying to beat math, you're probably attacking the wrong part of the problem. Learn about encryption below.

Things You Shouldn't Try to Do


Remember what we said earlier about how math will win, every time?

The corollary to the rule that you cannot beat math is "Never roll your own crypto". <https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnx8nq/why-you-dont-roll-your-own-crypto>. Anybody can write their own crypto libraries, but it probably sucks and is susceptible to attacks that were known in 1942. So when you see a CTF challenge with a "custom encryption library" or source code, know that whoever wrote that library implemented it wrong (intentionally).  In order to solve that challenge, you will need to know a great deal more about crypto than this course will try to teach you. If you want to become very very good at crypto, do the Matasano CryptoPals challenges. <https://cryptopals.com/> and take the Coursera Crypto 1 course. Otherwise, just move on with your life.

Moving on, if implemented properly (and the assumption for all standard libraries is that they are), the attacker will not beat math. It doesn't matter if you spin up a cloud server or build a facility in Utah, you're not going to beat math.  Anytime you find yourself trying to do any of these things, assume that you have gone wrong somewhere along the way.


1. Reverse a hash
   * If nothing comes up when you google for it, move on. This is not what you are supposed to solve.
2. Create a hash collision
    * Possible for MD5 and SHA1 in various ways. Read this for more info: <https://github.com/corkami/collisions>
3. Crack a password that is longer than 8 characters
   * The math just isn't there. You are missing something.
   * That something might just be a wordlist gathered from all words on a website/server/description

CTF Meta (I/P)


Web challenges are fun because they are the first step towards "hacking". Most of the time, the challenge provides a web address and port and the attacker has to figure out how to get a flag hidden somewhere on the server. The nice thing about WebEx challenges is that you can follow the same playbook every time that the professional pentesters do in order to ensure repeatable success in identifying what the flaw is... the hard part is actually exploiting the more complex flaws once you've identified the site is vulnerable to them.

1. What is SQL injection? What is a database injection other than SQL?
2. What are the different types of SQL injection?

As a helpful hint, 95% of SQL injects in basic challenges are as simple as pasting ' OR '1'='1 after a username or password. Truly wonderful.
In advanced challenge, SQL injects can be incredibly complicated and take days to figure out how to exploit after you initially identify that the site is vulnerable.

You Won't Learn That Here (I/P)


I don't believe this is a beginner topic! You should learn C and assembly before trying to do this stuff. Check out our course once I am done making it.

There are plenty of pwning and RE challenges in CTFs, but they are hard and will be in the Advanced CTFs course.

Here is some old stuff on it: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0F__fXm3TCqbXU3Sks5dndpWGc/view?usp=sharing>

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0F__fXm3TCqNmpxQjVVbEZjWW8/view?usp=sharing>


For RE I think this is the best resource: <https://microcorruption.com/>

For BinEx I really like this: <https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/linux-x86-exploit-development-tutorial-series/>
